period were multan lahore peshawer and thatta  which were chosen as the site of impressive mughal buildings in the early 16th century the region remained under the mughal empire in the 18th century the slow disintegration of the mughal empire was hastened by the emergence of the rival powers of the maratha confederacy and later the sikh empire as well as invasions by nader shah from iran in 1739 and the durrani empire of afghanistan in 1759 the growing political power of the british in bengal had not yet reached the territories of modern pakistan none of the territory of modern pakistan was ruled by the british until 1839 when karachi a small fishing village ruled by talpurs of sindh with a mud fort guarding the harbour was taken and held as an enclave with a port and military base for the first afghan war that soon followed the rest of sindh was taken in 1843 and in the following decades first the east india company and then after the postsepoy mutiny 1857–1858 direct rule of queen victoria of the british empire took over most of the country partly through wars and also treaties the main wars were that against the baloch talpur dynasty ended by the battle of miani 1843 in sindh the anglosikh wars 1845–1849 and the angloafghan wars 1839–1919 by 1893 all modern pakistan was part of the british indian empire and remained so until independence in 1947 under the british modern pakistan was mostly divided into the sind division punjab province and the baluchistan agency there were various princely states of which the largest was bahawalpur a rebellion in 1857 called the sepoy mutiny of bengal was the regions major armed struggle against the british divergence in the relationship between hinduism and islam created a major rift in british india that led to motivated religious violence in british india the language controversy further escalated the tensions between hindus and muslims the hindu renaissance witnessed an awakening of intellectualism in traditional hinduism and saw the emergence of more assertive influence in the social and political spheres in british india a muslim intellectual movement founded by sir syed ahmed khan to counter the hindu renaissance envisioned as well as advocated for the twonation theory and led to the creation of the allindia muslim league in 1906 in contrast to the indian national congresss antibritish efforts the muslim league was a probritish movement whose political program inherited the british values that would shape pakistans future civil society the largely nonviolent independence struggle led by the indian national congress under the leadership of mahatma gandhi engaged millions of protesters in mass campaigns of civil disobedience in the 1920s and 1930s against the british empire the muslim league slowly rose to mass popularity in the 1930s amid fears of underrepresentation and neglect by the british of the indian muslims in politics in his presidential address of 29 december 1930 allama iqbal called for the amalgamation of northwest muslimmajority indian states consisting of punjab northwest frontier province sind and baluchistan the perceived neglect of muslim interests by congress led british provincial governments during the period of 1937–39 convinced muhammad ali jinnah the founder of pakistan to espouse the twonation theory and led the muslim league to adopt the lahore resolution of 1940 presented by sherebangla ak fazlul haque popularly known as the pakistan resolution in world war ii jinnah and britisheducated founding fathers in the muslim league supported the united kingdoms war efforts countering opposition against it whilst working towards sir syeds vision the 1946 elections resulted in the muslim league winning 90\\xa0percent of the seats reserved for muslims thus the 1946 election was seen as a plebiscite in which the indian muslims were to vote on the creation of pakistan a plebiscite won by the muslim league this victory was assisted by the support given to the muslim league by the support of the landowners of sindh and punjab the indian national congress which initially denied the muslim leagues claim of being the sole representative of indian muslims was now forced to recognise the fact the british had no alternative except to take jinnahs views into account as he had emerged as the sole spokesperson of the entirety of british indias muslims however the british did not want colonial india to be partitioned and in one last effort to prevent it they devised the cabinet mission plan as the cabinet mission failed the british government announced its intention to end the british rule in 1946–47 nationalists in british india—including jawaharlal nehru and abul kalam azad of congress jinnah of the allindia muslim league and master tara singh representing the sikhs—agreed to the proposed terms of transfer of power and independence in june 1947 with the viceroy of india lord mountbatten of burma as the united kingdom agreed to the partitioning of india in 1947 the modern state of pakistan was established on 14 august 1947 27th of ramadan in 1366 of the islamic calendar amalgamating the muslimmajority eastern and northwestern regions of british india it comprised the provinces of balochistan east bengal the northwest frontier province west punjab and sindh in the riots that accompanied the partition in punjab province it is believed that between 200000 and 2000000 people were killed in what some have described as a retributive genocide between the religions while 50000 muslim women were abducted and raped by hindu and sikh men 33000 hindu and sikh women also experienced the same fate at the hands of muslims around 65\\xa0million muslims moved from india to west pakistan and 47\\xa0million hindus and

jinnahs first speech to the constituent assembly of pakistan maulana shabbir ahmad usmani a respected deobandi alim scholar who occupied the position of shaykh alislam in pakistan in 1949 and maulana mawdudi of jamaatiislami played a pivotal role in the demand for an islamic constitution mawdudi demanded that the constituent assembly make an explicit declaration affirming the supreme sovereignty of god and the supremacy of the shariah in pakistan a significant result of the efforts of the jamaatiislami and the ulama was the passage of the objectives resolution in march 1949 the objectives resolution which liaquat ali khan called the second most important step in pakistans history declared that sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to god almighty alone and the authority which he has delegated to the state of pakistan through its people for being exercised within the limits prescribed by him is a sacred trust the objectives resolution has been incorporated as a preamble to the constitutions of 1956 1962 and 1973 democracy was stalled by the martial law that had been enforced by president iskander mirza who was replaced by the commanderinchief of the pakistan army general ayub khan after adopting a presidential system in 1962 the country experienced exceptional growth until a second war with india in 1965 that led to an economic downturn and widescale public disapproval in 1967 consolidating control from ayub khan in 1969 president yahya khan had to deal with a devastating cyclone that caused 500000 deaths in east pakistan in 1970 pakistan held its first democratic elections since independence meant to mark a transition from military rule to democracy but after the east pakistani awami league won against the pakistan peoples party ppp yahya khan and the military establishment refused to hand over power operation searchlight a military crackdown on the bengali nationalist movement led to a declaration of independence and the waging of a war of liberation by the bengali mukti bahini forces in east pakistan which in west pakistan was described as a civil war as opposed to a war of liberation independent researchers estimate that between 300000 and 500000 civilians died during this period while the bangladesh government puts the number of dead at three million a figure that is now nearly universally regarded as excessively inflated some academics such as rudolph rummel and rounaq jahan say both sides committed genocide others such as richard sisson and leo e rose believe there was no genocide in response to indias support for the insurgency in east pakistan preemptive strikes on india by pakistans air force navy and marines sparked a conventional war in 1971 that resulted in an indian victory and east pakistan gaining

response to indias first nuclear test in 1974 this crash program was completed in 1979 democracy ended with a military coup in 1977 against the leftist ppp which saw general ziaulhaq become the president in 1978 from 1977 to 1988 president zias corporatisation and economic islamisation initiatives led to pakistan becoming one of the fastestgrowing economies in south asia while building up the countrys nuclear program increasing islamisation and the rise of a homegrown conservative philosophy pakistan helped subsidise and distribute us resources to factions of the mujahideen against the ussrs intervention in communist afghanistan pakistans northwest frontier province became a base for the antisoviet afghan fighters with the provinces influential deobandi ulama playing a significant role in encouraging and organising the jihad president zia died in a plane crash in 1988 and benazir bhutto daughter of zulfikar ali bhutto was elected as the countrys first female prime minister the ppp was followed by conservative pakistan muslim league n and over the next decade the leaders of the two parties fought for power alternating in office while the countrys situation worsened economic indicators fell sharply in contrast to the 1980s this period is marked by prolonged stagflation instability corruption nationalism geopolitical rivalry with india and the clash of left wingright wing ideologies as pml n secured a supermajority in elections in 1997 nawaz sharif authorised nuclear testings seechagaii and chagaiii as a retaliation to the second nuclear tests ordered by india led by

elected as pakistans new prime minister after imran khan lost a noconfidence vote in the parliament pakistan is the only country to have been created in the name of islam the idea of pakistan which had received overwhelming popular support among muslims especially those in the provinces of british india where muslims were in a minority such as the united provinces was articulated in terms of an islamic state by the muslim league leadership the ulama islamic clergy and jinnah jinnah had developed a close association with the ulama and upon his death was described by one such alim maulana shabbir ahmad usmani as the greatest muslim after aurangzeb and as someone who desired to unite the muslims of the world under the banner of islam the objectives resolution in march 1949 which declared god as the sole sovereign over the entire universe represented the first formal step to transform pakistan into an islamic state muslim league leader chaudhry khaliquzzaman asserted that pakistan could only truly become an islamic state after bringing all believers of islam into a single political unit keith callard one of the earliest scholars on pakistani politics observed that pakistanis believed in the essential unity of purpose and outlook in the muslim world and assumed that muslim from other countries would share their views on the relationship between religion and nationality however pakistans panislamist sentiments for a united islamic bloc called islamistan were not shared by other muslim governments although islamists such as the grand mufti of palestine alhaj amin alhusseini and leaders of the muslim brotherhood became drawn to the country pakistans desire for an international organization of muslim countries was fulfilled in the 1970s when the organization of islamic conference oic was formed the strongest opposition to the islamist ideological paradigm being imposed on the state came from the bengali muslims of east pakistan whose educated class according to a survey by social scientist nasim ahmad jawed preferred secularism and focused on ethnic identity unlike educated west pakistanis who tended to prefer an islamic identity the islamist party jamaateislami considered pakistan to be an islamic state and believed bengali nationalism to be unacceptable in the 1971 conflict over east pakistan the jamaateislami fought the bengali nationalists on the pakistan armys side the conflict concluded with east pakistan seceding and the creation of independent bangladesh after pakistans first ever general elections the 1973 constitution was created by an elected parliament the constitution declared pakistan an islamic republic and islam as the state religion it also stated that all laws would have to be brought into accordance with the injunctions of islam as laid down in the quran and sunnah and that no law repugnant to such injunctions could be enacted the 1973 constitution also created certain institutions such as the shariat court and the council of islamic ideology to channel the interpretation and application of islam pakistans leftist prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto faced vigorous opposition which coalesced into a movement united under the revivalist banner of nizamemustafa rule of the prophet which aimed to establish an islamic state based on sharia laws bhutto agreed to some islamist demands before being overthrown in a coup in 1977 after taking power from bhutto in a coup détat general ziaulhaq who came from a religious background committed himself to establishing an islamic state and enforcing sharia law zia established separate shariat judicial courts and court benches to judge legal cases using islamic doctrine zia bolstered the influence of the ulama islamic clergy and the islamic parties ziaulhaq forged a strong alliance between the military and deobandi institutions and even though most barelvi ulama and only a few deobandi scholars had supported pakistans creation islamic state politics came to be mostly in favour of deobandi and later ahlehadithsalafi institutions instead of barelvi sectarian tensions increased with zias antishia policies according to a pew research center pew opinion poll a majority of pakistanis support making sharia the official law of the land in a survey of several muslim countries pew also found that pakistanis tend to identify with their religion more than their nationality in contrast to muslims in other nations such as egypt indonesia and jordan the geography and climate of pakistan are extremely diverse and the country is home to a

selfsufficient in sugarcane and is the fourthlargest producer in the world of milk land and water resources have not risen proportionately but the increases have taken place mainly due to gains in labour and agriculture productivity the major breakthrough in crop production took place in the late 1960s and 1970s due to the green revolution that made a significant contribution to land and yield increases of wheat and rice private tube wells led to a 50 percent increase in the cropping intensity which was augmented by tractor cultivation while the tube wells raised crop yields by 50 percent the high yielding varieties hyvs of wheat and rice led to a 50–60 percent higher yield meat industry accounts for 14 percent of overall gdp industry is the secondlargest sector of the economy

complex in karachi with plans of additional reactors similar to the one in chashma the electrical energy is generated by various energy corporations and evenly distributed by the national electric power regulatory authority nepra among the four provinces however the karachibased kelectric and the water and power development authority wapda generates much of the electrical energy used in

traffic the pakistan railways under the ministry of railways mor operates the railroad system from 1947 until the 1970s the train system was the primary means of transport until the nationwide constructions of the national highways and the economic boom of the automotive industry beginning in the 1990s there was a marked shift in traffic from rail to highways dependence grew on roads after the introduction of vehicles in the country now the railways share of inland traffic is below 8 for passengers and 4 for freight traffic as personal transportation began to be dominated by the

pakistans population expanded over sixfold going from 337\\xa0million to 2077\\xa0million the country has a relatively high although declining growth rate supported by high birth rates and low death rates between 1998 and 2017 the average annual population growth rate stood at 240 dramatic social changes have led to urbanisation and the emergence of two megacities karachi and lahore the countrys urban population more than tripled between 1981 and 2017 from 238\\xa0million to 757\\xa0million as pakistans urbanisation rate rose from 282 to 364 even with this the nations urbanisation rate remains one of the lowest in the world and in 2017 over 130 million pakistanis making up nearly 65 of the population lived in rural areas due to a high fertility rate estimated at 35 in 2022 pakistan

in official business and government and in legal contracts the local variety is known as pakistani english the enforcement of urdu to the exclusion of other majority languages has been criticised in

disadvantage according to the 2017 national census of pakistan the countrys largest ethnolinguistic groups were the punjabis making up 388 of the total population the pashtuns 182 sindhis 146 saraikis

sheedis who are of african descent and the hazaras there are also scattered speakers of gujarati in karachi there is also a large pakistani diaspora worldwide numbering over seven million which has been recorded as the sixth largest diaspora in the world even after partition in 1947 indian muslims continued to migrate to pakistan throughout the 1950s and 1960s and these migrants settled mainly in karachi and other towns of sindh province the wars in neighboring afghanistan during the 1980s and 1990s also forced millions of afghan refugees into pakistan the pakistan census excludes the 141\\xa0million registered refugees from afghanistan who are found mainly in the khyberpakhtunkhwa and tribal belt with small numbers residing in karachi and quetta pakistan is home to one of the worlds largest refugee populations in addition to afghans around 2\\xa0million bangladeshis and half a million other undocumented people live in pakistan they are claimed to be from other areas such as myanmar iran iraq and africa experts say that the migration of both bengalis and burmese rohingya to pakistan started in the 1980s and continued until 1998 shaikh muhammad feroze the chairman of the pakistani bengali action committee claims that there are 200 settlements of bengalispeaking people in pakistan of which 132 are in karachi they are also found in various other areas of pakistan such as thatta badin hyderabad tando adam and lahore largescale rohingya migration to karachi made that city one of the largest population centres of rohingyas in the world after myanmar the burmese community of karachi is spread out over 60 of the citys slums such as the burmi colony in korangi arakanabad machchar colony bilal colony ziaul haq colony and godhra camp thousands of uyghur muslims have also migrated to the gilgitbaltistan region of pakistan fleeing religious and cultural persecution in xinjiang china since 1989 thousands of kashmiri muslim refugees have sought refuge in pakistan complaining that many of the refugee women had been raped by indian soldiers and that they were forced out of their homes by the soldiers since achieving independence as a result of the partition of india the urbanisation has increased exponentially with several different causes the majority of the population in the south resides along the indus river with karachi the most populous commercial city in the east west and north most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of lahore faisalabad rawalpindi islamabad sargodha gujranwala sialkot gujrat jhelum sheikhupura nowshera mardan and peshawar during the period 1990–2008 city dwellers made up 36 of pakistans population making it the most urbanised nation in south asia furthermore more than 50 of pakistanis live in towns of 5000 people or more immigration from both within and outside the country is regarded as one of the main factors contributing to urbanisation in pakistan one analysis of the 1998 national census highlighted the significance of the partition of india in the 1940s as it relates to urban change in pakistan\\nduring and after the independence period urdu speaking muslims from india migrated in large numbers to pakistan especially to the port city of karachi which is today the largest metropolis in pakistan migration from other countries mainly from those nearby has further accelerated the process of urbanisation in pakistani cities inevitably the rapid urbanisation caused by these large population movements has also created new political and socioeconomic challenges in addition to immigration economic trends such as the green revolution and political developments among a host of other factors are also important causes of urbanisation islam is the state religion of pakistan freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution which provides all its citizens the right to profess practice and propagate their religion subject to law public order and morality the majority of pakistanis are muslims 9647 followed by hindus 214 and christians 127 there are also smaller minorities who adhere to sikhism buddhism jainism and zoroastrianism parsi the kalash people

yatra pilgrimage hindu temples may be found throughout sindh where the dharma features prominently many hindus in pakistan complain about the prospect of religious violence against them and being treated like secondclass citizens and many have emigrated to india or further abroad in addition some pakistanis also do not profess any faith such as atheists and agnostics in pakistan according to the 1998 census people who did not state their religion accounted for 05 of the population islam is the dominant religion about 9647 of pakistanis are muslim according to the 2017 census pakistan has

international convention administered by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco world heritage sites are designated by unesco for having cultural historical scientific or other forms of significance the sites are judged to contain cultural and natural heritage around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity to be selected a world heritage site must be a somehow unique landmark which is geographically and historically identifiable and has special cultural or physical significance for example world heritage sites might be ancient ruins or historical structures buildings citiesa deserts forests islands lakes monuments mountains or wilderness areas a world heritage site may signify a remarkable accomplishment of humanity and serve as evidence of our intellectual history on the planet or it might be a place of great natural beauty as of september 2023 a total of 1199 world heritage sites 933 cultural 227 natural and 39 mixed properties exist across 168 countries with 59 selected areas italy is the country with the most sites followed by china with 57 then france and germany with 52 each the sites are intended for practical conservation for posterity which otherwise would be subject to risk from human or animal trespassing unmonitored uncontrolled or unrestricted access or threat from local administrative negligence sites are demarcated by unesco as protected zones the world heritage sites list is maintained by the international world heritage program administered by the unesco world heritage committee composed of 21 states parties that are elected by their general assembly the programme catalogues names and conserves sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common culture and heritage of humanity the programme began with the convention concerning the protection of the worlds cultural and natural heritage which was adopted by the general conference of unesco on 16 november 1972 since then 195 states have ratified the convention making it one of the most widely recognised international agreements and the worlds most popular cultural programme in 1954 the government of egypt decided to build the new aswan high dam whose resulting future reservoir would eventually inundate a large stretch of the nile valley containing cultural treasures of ancient egypt and ancient nubia in 1959 the governments of egypt and sudan requested unesco to assist them to protect and rescue the endangered monuments and sites in 1960 the directorgeneral of unesco launched the international campaign to save the monuments of nubia this international campaign to save the monuments of nubia resulted in the excavation and recording of hundreds of sites the recovery of thousands of objects as well as the salvage and relocation to higher ground of several important temples the most famous of these are the temple complexes of abu simbel and philae the campaign ended in 1980 and was considered a success to thank countries which especially contributed to the campaigns success egypt donated four temples the temple of dendur was moved to the metropolitan museum of art in new york city the temple of debod to the parque del oeste in madrid the temple of taffeh to the rijksmuseum van oudheden in leiden and the temple of ellesyia to museo egizio in turin the project cost us80\\xa0million equivalent to 28414\\xa0million in 2022 about 40\\xa0million of which was collected from 50 countries the projects success led to other safeguarding campaigns such as saving venice and its lagoon in italy the ruins of mohenjodaro in pakistan and the borobodur temple compounds in indonesia together with the international council on monuments and sites unesco then initiated a draft convention to protect cultural heritage the convention the signed document of international agreement guiding the work of the world heritage committee was developed over a sevenyear period 1965–1972 the united states initiated the idea of safeguarding places of high cultural or natural importance a white house conference in 1965 called for a world heritage trust to preserve the worlds superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future of the entire world citizenry the international union for conservation of nature developed similar proposals in 1968 which were presented in 1972 at the united nations conference on the human environment in stockholm under the world heritage committee signatory countries are required to produce and submit periodic data reporting providing the committee with an overview of each participating nations implementation of the world heritage convention and a snapshot of current conditions at world heritage propertiescitation needed based on the draft convention that unesco had initiated a single text was eventually agreed upon by all parties and the convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage was adopted by the general conference of unesco on 16 november 1972 the convention came into force on 17 december 1975 as of may 2023 it has been ratified by 195 states 191 un member states 2 un observer states the holy see and the state of palestine and 2 states in free association with new zealand the cook islands and niue only two un member states have not ratified the convention liechtenstein and nauru by assigning places as world heritage sites unesco wants to help to pass them on to future generations its motivation is that heritage is our legacy from the past what we live with today and that both cultural and natural heritage are irreplaceable sources of life and inspiration unescos mission with respect to world heritage consists of eight sub targets these include encouraging the commitment of countries and local population to world heritage conservation in various ways providing emergency assistance for sites in danger offering technical assistance and professional training and supporting states parties public awarenessbuilding activities being listed as a world heritage site can positively affect the site its environment and interactions between them a listed site gains international recognition and legal protection and can obtain funds from among others the world heritage fund to facilitate its conservation under certain conditions unesco reckons the restorations of the following four sites among its success stories angkor in cambodia the old city of dubrovnik in croatia the wieliczka salt mine near kraków in poland and the ngorongoro conservation area in tanzania additionally the local population around a site may benefit from significantly increased tourism revenue when there are significant interactions between people and the natural environment these can be recognised as cultural landscapesb a country must first identify its significant cultural and natural sites in a document known as the tentative list next it can place sites selected from that list into a nomination file which is evaluated by the international council on monuments and sites and the world conservation union a country may not nominate sites that have not been first included on its tentative list the two international bodies make recommendations to the world heritage committee for new designations the committee meets once a year to determine what nominated properties to add to the world heritage list sometimes it defers its decision or requests more information from the country that nominated the site there are ten selection criteria – a site must meet at least one to be included on the list until 2004 there were six sets of criteria for cultural heritage and four for natural heritage in 2005 unesco modified these and now has one set of ten criteria nominated sites must be of outstanding universal value and must meet at least one of the ten criteria a country may request to extend or reduce the boundaries modify the official name or change the selection criteria of one of its already listed sites any proposal for a significant boundary change or to modify the sites selection criteria must be submitted as if it were a new nomination including first placing it on the tentative list and then onto the nomination file a request for a minor boundary change one that does not have a significant impact on the extent of the property or affect its outstanding universal value is also evaluated by the advisory bodies before being sent to the committee such proposals can be rejected by either the advisory bodies or the committee if they judge it to be a significant change instead of a minor one proposals to change a sites official name are sent directly to the committee a site may be added to the list of world heritage in danger if conditions threaten the characteristics for which the landmark or area was inscribed on the world heritage list such problems may involve armed conflict and war natural disasters pollution poaching or uncontrolled urbanisation or human development this danger list is intended to increase international awareness of the threats and to encourage counteractive measures threats to a site can be either proven imminent threats or potential dangers that could have adverse effects on a site the state of conservation for each site on the danger list is reviewed yearly after this the committee may request additional measures delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased or consider deletion from both the list of world heritage in danger and the world heritage list only three sites have ever been delisted the arabian oryx sanctuary in oman the dresden elbe valley in germany and the liverpool maritime mercantile city in the united kingdom the arabian oryx sanctuary was directly delisted in 2007 instead of first being put on the danger list after the omani government decided to reduce the protected areas size by 90 per cent the dresden elbe valley was first placed on the danger list in 2006 when the world heritage committee decided that plans to construct the waldschlösschen bridge would significantly alter the valleys landscape in response dresden city council attempted to stop the bridges construction however after several court decisions allowed the building of the bridge to proceed the valley was removed from the world heritage list in 2009 liverpools world heritage status was revoked in july 2021 following developments liverpool waters and bramleymoore dock stadium on the northern docks of the world heritage site leading to the irreversible loss of attributes on the site the first global assessment to quantitatively measure threats to natural world heritage sites found that 63 per cent of sites have been damaged by increasing human pressures including encroaching roads agriculture infrastructure and settlements over the last two decades these activities endanger natural world heritage sites and could compromise their unique values of the natural world heritage sites that contain forest 91 per cent experienced some loss since 2000 many of them are more threatened than previously thought and require immediate conservation action furthermore the destruction of cultural assets and identityestablishing sites is one of the primary goals of modern asymmetrical warfare therefore terrorists rebels and mercenary armies deliberately smash archaeological sites sacred and secular monuments and loot libraries archives and museums the un united nations peacekeeping and unesco in cooperation with blue shield international are active in preventing such acts no strike lists are also created to protect cultural assets from air strikes however only through cooperation with the locals can the protection of world heritage sites archaeological finds exhibits and archaeological sites from destruction looting and robbery be implemented sustainably the founding president of blue shield international karl von habsburg summed it up with the words without the local community and without the local participants that would be completely impossible the unescoadministered project has attracted criticism this was caused by perceived underrepresentation of heritage sites outside europe disputed decisions on site selection and adverse impact of mass tourism on sites unable to manage rapid growth in visitor numbers a large lobbying industry has grown around the awards because world heritage listing can significantly increase tourism returns site listing bids are often lengthy and costly putting poorer countries at a disadvantage eritreas efforts to promote asmara are one example in 2016 the australian government was reported to have successfully lobbied for the world heritage site great barrier reef conservation efforts to be removed from a unesco report titled world heritage and tourism in a changing climate the australian governments actions involving considerable expense for lobbying and visits for diplomats were in response to their concern about the negative impact that an at risk label could have on tourism revenue at a previously designated unesco world heritage site in 2021 international scientists recommended unesco to put the great barrier reef on the endangered list as global climate change had caused a further negative state of the corals and water quality again the australian government campaigned against this and in july 2021 the world heritage committee made up diplomatic representatives of 21 countries ignored unescos assessment based on studies of scientists that the reef was clearly in danger from climate change and so should be placed on the list according to environmental protection groups this decision was a victory for cynical lobbying and that australia as custodians of the worlds biggest coral reef was now on probation several listed locations such as casco viejo in panama and hội an in vietnam have struggled to strike a balance between the economic benefits of catering to greatly increased visitor numbers after the recognition and preserving the original culture and local communities another criticism is that there is a homogeneity to these sites which contain similar styles visitor centres etc meaning that a lot of the individuality of these sites has been removed to become more attractive to tourists unesco has also been criticized for alleged geographic bias racism and colorism in world heritage inscription a major chunk of all world heritage inscriptions are located in regions whose populations generally have lighter skin including europe east asia and north america the world heritage committee has divided the world into five geographic zones which it calls regions africa arab states asia and the pacific europe and north america and latin america and the caribbean russia and the caucasus states are classified as european while mexico and the caribbean are classified as belonging to the latin america and the caribbean zone the unesco geographic zones also give greater emphasis on administrative rather than geographic associations hence gough island located in the south atlantic is part of the europe and north america region because the british government nominated the site the table below includes a breakdown of the sites according to these zones and their classification as of september\\xa02023update this overview lists the 23 countries with 15 or more world heritage sites the indus river delta forms where the indus river flows into the arabian sea mostly in the southern sindh province of pakistan with a small portion in the kutch region of india the delta covers an area of about 41440\\xa0km2 16000 square miles and is approximately 210\\xa0km 130\\xa0mi across where it meets the sea the active part of the delta is 6000\\xa0km2 in area 2300\\xa0sq\\xa0mi the climate is arid the region only receives between 25 and 50 centimetres 98 and 197\\xa0in of rainfall in a normal year the delta is home to the largest arid mangrove forests in the world as well as many birds fish and the indus dolphin since the 1940s the delta has received less water as a result of largescale irrigation works capturing large amounts of the indus water before it reaches the delta the result has been catastrophic for both the environment and the local population as a result the 2010 pakistan floods were considered good news for the ecosystem and population of the river delta as they brought much needed fresh water the population of the active part of the delta was estimated at 900000 in 2003 most of the population depends on agriculture and fishing mangrove forests provide fuel wood many former settlements in the delta have been abandoned as result of lack of water in the indus and the encroaching arabian sea according to some accounts the macedonian fleet of alexander the great anchored itself for some time in the indus river delta it was damaged by a tsunami generated by an earthquake off the makran coast in 325 bc according to tarikhihind also known as the chach nama by 6th century ad there existed a port called debal in what is now the western part of the indus delta debal also seemed to be the base of pirates from the tribe of nagamara these pirates raids against the umayyads and the refusal to redress the issue by the ruling prince precipitated the muslim conquest around 710 ad by muhammad bin qasim debal remained a port and the last recorded mention of it was in 1223 ad by the time ibn batuta reached the indus delta debal had been abandoned due to increased shoaling preventing the thenport from accessing the sea when the abbasid caliphate began to disintegrate the delta came under the control of the increasingly autonomous province centered at mansura the eastern part of the delta was even more independent and controlled by the sumra tribe until 1053 ad when the region was brought under the control of the khalji delhi sultanate by alauddin khalji the tribe had several capitals but none are populated today in 1333 ad the samma dynasty ruled all of the delta and established their capital first at samui on the south bank of keenjhar lake and later at thatta it was during this dynasty that the golden age of native rule 14611509 ad happened in the delta and sindh under the rule of jam nizamuddin ii from 1591 to 1592 the mughal empire waged a campaign to bring lower sindh under imperial rule resulting in the delta coming under the province of multan and ruled by mirza ghazi beg in 1739 the region along with many others was ceded to nadir shah the kalhora ruled the region until 1783 the power then transferred to the talpurs until the british east india company conquered them in 1839 in 1947 the indus delta along with rest of sindh became a part of pakistan since 1957 the sindh forest and wildlife department has been tasked with protecting and managing 280580 hectares 693300 acres estimated 45 of mangroveforested area of the indus delta in 1973 64405 hectares 159150 acres 11 were transferred to port qasim the sindh board of revenue continues to manage 272485 hectares 673330 acres 44 of the area in december 2010 realizing the importance of mangrove conservation the government of sindh declared all the mangrove forests in the indus delta as protected forests under the forest act of 1927 apart from this action a mangrove conservation committee with membership of all the relevant stakeholders has been formed to ensure the sustainable conservation of the indus delta mangroves the end estimated coastline of the indus delta with the arabian sea the maximum length in the direction of the coast is approximated at 210\\xa0km 130\\xa0mi 220\\xa0km and 240\\xa0km 150\\xa0mi because the indus river has switched its location at various points in history it has an active delta region and total delta region all area that was once a part of the delta the total area is estimated at 29524\\xa0km2 11399\\xa0sq\\xa0mi 30000\\xa0km2 12000\\xa0sq\\xa0mi and 41440\\xa0km2 16000\\xa0sq\\xa0mi the active area is estimated at 4762\\xa0km2 1839\\xa0sq\\xa0mi and 6000\\xa0km2 2300\\xa0sq\\xa0mi the length of the total delta along the axis of indus is estimated at 240\\xa0km 150\\xa0mi whereas the current delta stretches from the arabian sea to just south of thatta 100\\xa0km or 62\\xa0mi there are currently 17 major creeksincluding sir creek bhitiaro creek and kori creek and numerous minor creeks the delta receives almost all of its water from the indus river which has an annual flow of approximately 180\\xa0billion cubic metres 240\\xa0billion cubic yards and is accompanied by 400 million tonnes of silt since the 1940s dams barrages and irrigation works have been constructed on the river indus in fact the world bank has characterized the works as the worlds largest and the indus basin irrigation system as the largest contiguous irrigation system developed over\\nthe past 140 years anywhere in the world this has served to reduce the flow of water and by 1994 the annual flow of water into the delta was 43×109\\xa0m3 15×1012\\xa0cu\\xa0ft and annual amount of silt discharged was estimated to be 100\\xa0million tonnes 98\\xa0million long tons since 1994 the water flow has decreased as punjab has been allocated a higher share of the water the climate of the delta is described as arid it receives only 250–500\\xa0mm 98–197\\xa0in of rain in a normal year average temperatures for the delta region range from 21 to 30\\xa0°c 7085\\xa0°f in july and 1021\\xa0°c 5070\\xa0°f in january\\nduring the summer the delta experiences intense monsoonal winds from the southwest causing parts of the delta to be covered by seawater when this water retreats it leaves behind salts in the deltas soil during the winter the winds in the delta come from the northeast the summer monsoonal winds also contribute to high wave energy levels in fact the delta is subjected to the highest wave action of any river delta in the world the amount of wave energy the indus delta receives in a single day is greater than that received by the  mississippi river delta in a year throughout history the delta has survived this wave action because of the large discharge of fresh water to counter the erosional impact of waves this large amount of wave energy coupled with lack of silt flowing in from the indus river as mentioned above has resulted in the formation of sand beaches the indus river started to form some 50 million years ago 25 million years ago the indus plain was lifted mangrove forests are one of the most abundant ecological communities of the delta but they have declined over the years according to haq et al they covered an area of 600000 hectares 1500000 acres until the 1980s and could be found along the entire 240\\xa0km coastline in 40 of the tidal zone and in 10 of the delta fan memon reports that the area of mangrove forests was 263000 hectares in 1977 and 158500\\xa0ha 392000 acres in 1990 both agree that they were sixthlargest mangrove forests in the world previously there had been eight species of mangroves although only four now remain aegiceras corniculatum avicennia marina ceriops tagal and rhizophora mucronata among these avicennia marina constitutes 99 of the mangrove population as of 2007 the mangroves of the indus delta are the largest desert climate mangrove forests in the world however the indus delta saw an increase in number of mangroves after preservation and plantation initiatives mangrove forests of indus delta now cover an area of around 600 000 hectares the mangroves are under control of three different organizations namely\\n sindh forest department 280 470 ha\\n port qasim authority 64 400 ha\\n sindh board of revenue 255 130 ha arthrocnemum macrostachyum is also found growing in the delta the natural flow of water and fertile sediments from indus river into the delta has been impeded due to the construction of dams along the river the reduction of freshwater due to the dams also increases salinity making the waters of the delta unsuitable for the freshwater species in case of the indus dolphin the damming of the river has isolated the delta dolphin population from those dolphins upstream\\nthe 2010 pakistan floods were considered good news for the ecosystem of the river delta as they brought an excess of much needed fresh water the sindh government announced that 8000 hectares of mangrove forests had been planted and more plantation was considered however the delta has lost 170000 hectares of mangroves over the past 50 years the delta faces pollution both from sea and the indus river chemical runoff into the river threatens many species most of this chemical runoff consists of agriculture pesticide and fertilizer  the delta faces pollution from the arabian sea karachi pakistans largest city releases sewage and discharge from industrial units into the arabian sea most of which is untreated both port of karachi and port qasim handle significant shipping traffic resulting in oil discharge some of which reaches the delta all of this pollution lowers the river water quality causes eutrophication reducing the amount of habitat indus delta has shrunk by 92 since 1833 in light of the threats indus delta was designated a ramsar site on november 5 2002 the wwf is working on conservation methods to alleviate the indus deltas shortage of freshwater the population of the delta was estimated at 900000 in 2003 the total population of indus river deltaarabian sea mangroves was 12 million within the river delta about 140000 people 16 of the population depended on the mangrove forests for their livelihood and 60 depended on the forests for fuels at least 75 of the population in the active delta depend on the fishing industry the population suffers from the lack of health facilities and medical staff only about a third of the population has access to clean drinking water ethnic groups of lower sindh can be found in the delta region mallaah mohano soomro samma and jat all of these groups speak sindhi and follow islam the delta falls within the districts of thatta and badin of the sindh province pakistans fifth largest city hyderabad lies about 130 miles north of the mouths of the indus towns are found throughout the delta but there are no large cities on the delta south of hyderabad karachi pakistans largest city lies west of the delta on the coast of the arabian sea the 2010 floods displaced nearly 1 million people in southern sindh including those living in the delta in spite of this displacement and other destruction caused in the rest of pakistan however many people in the delta considered the floods as good news villagers reported abundance of fresh water for drinking and agriculture fishermen reported increase in catches the economy of the delta consists of agriculture and fishing as of 2005 more than 140000 hectares of land were used for agriculture mostly used to cultivate rice followed by sugarcane and wheat barley gram oil seeds maize millet cotton and jowar are other important crops fruits such as coconut mango fig pomegranate apple peach\\nmelon banana guava and papaya are also reportedly grown the delta also used to have large pastures for livestock grazing as of 2003 fishing was an important source of revenue catches of mangrove dependent fish were valued at 20 million annually shrimp at 70 million and mud crabs at 3 million as a result of resource degradation a large exodus of people has taken place from the indus delta altaf memom estimates that 90000 have been displaced and about 120 villages have been depopulated one reason give is the shortage of local bushes and plants that are used for preparing various materials especially by the jat villagers others have migrated due to lack of potable drinking water the pakistan fisherfolk forum estimates that 14400 people from the delta coast majority of them fishermen are amongst those that have left kharochan until the 1970s was a bustling city in the delta its port was used to export locally grown silk rice and wood however rising salinity destroyed the local agriculture and the port was lost to the encroaching arabian sea by 2006 in 2009 the world wildlife fund wwf constructed a large water reservoir of capacity 12000 litres 2600\\xa0imp\\xa0gal 3200\\xa0us\\xa0gal in tippin village at keti bandar and a few  plastic storage tanks with a capacity of 4000 litres it also set up 200watt solar panels to supply electricity to a school finally it installed two 500watt wind turbines electricity was previously unavailable due to high cost of establishing power lines in the difficulttoaccess area in 2010 sindh radiant organization in partnership with wwf installed a solarpowered desalination plant developed by the pakistan council of scientific and industrial research in the village of jat mohammad the plant is capable of providing 40 gallons of drinking water every day while the plant is not enough to meet the needs of the entire village pakistans ministry of science and other ngos have shown interest in replicating it to alleviate water shortages in the delta research and development foundation a pakistani ngo has also started implementing solar desalination in six villages in thatta with funding from oxfam the united nations economic and social commission for asia and the pacific has estimated the potential of generating 100kw of electricity by harnessing the power of tidal currents along 170\\xa0km 110\\xa0mi of the deltas coastline pakistani fishermen in the delta have increasingly faced detention for accidentally straying over into indian waters while fishing fishermen have been forced to fish near the border as a result of destruction of ecosystems elsewhere in the delta because the boundaries between india and pakistan are poorly demarcated in some areas eg sir creek fishermen often dont know when theyve crossed the border ngos say that under indian laws fisherman can face at most three months in prison and a 12 fine however most are jailed for a year and their boats are sold at an auction indian fishermen crossing into pakistan face a similar fate the indus valley civilisation  ivc also known as the indus civilisation was a bronze age civilisation in the northwestern regions of south asia lasting from 3300\\xa0bce to 1300\\xa0bce and in its mature form 2600\\xa0bce to 1900\\xa0bcea together with ancient egypt and mesopotamia it was one of three early civilisations of the near east and south asia and of the three the most widespread its sites spanning an area from much of pakistan to northeast afghanistan and northwestern indiab the civilisation flourished both in the alluvial plain of the indus river which flows through the length of pakistan and along a system of perennial monsoonfed rivers that once coursed in the vicinity of the ghaggarhakra a seasonal river in northwest india and eastern pakistan the term harappan is sometimes applied to the indus civilisation after its type site harappa the first to be excavated early in the 20th\\xa0century in what was then the punjab province of british india and is now punjab pakistanc the discovery of harappa and soon afterwards mohenjodaro was the culmination of work that had begun after the founding of the archaeological survey of india in the british raj in 1861 there were earlier and later cultures called early harappan and late harappan in the same area the early harappan cultures were populated from neolithic cultures the earliest and bestknown of which is mehrgarh in balochistan pakistan harappan civilisation is sometimes called mature harappan to distinguish it from the earlier cultures the cities of the ancient indus were noted for their urban planning baked brick houses elaborate drainage systems water supply systems clusters of large nonresidential buildings and techniques of handicraft and metallurgyd mohenjodaro and harappa very likely grew to contain between 30000 and 60000 individuals and the civilisation may have contained between one and five million individuals during its florescence  a gradual drying of the region during the 3rd\\xa0millennium bce may have been the initial stimulus for its urbanisation eventually it also reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisations demise and to disperse its population to the easte although over a thousand mature harappan sites have been reported and nearly a hundred excavatedf there are five\\xa0major urban centresg mohenjodaro in the lower indus valley declared a unesco world heritage site in 1980 as archaeological ruins at moenjodaro harappa in the western punjab region ganeriwala in the cholistan desert dholavira in western gujarat declared a unesco world heritage site in 2021 as dholavira a harappan city and rakhigarhi in haryanah the harappan language is not directly attested and its affiliations are uncertain as the indus script has remained undeciphered a relationship with the dravidian or elamodravidian language family is favoured by a section of scholars the indus civilisation is named after the indus river system in whose alluvial plains the early sites of the civilisation were identified and excavatedi following a tradition in archaeology the civilisation is sometimes referred to as the harappan after its type site harappa the first site to be excavated in the 1920s this is notably true of usage employed by the archaeological survey of india after indias independence in 1947j the term ghaggarhakra figures prominently in modern labels applied to the indus civilisation on account of a good number of sites having been found along the ghaggarhakra river in northwest india and eastern pakistan the terms indussarasvati civilisation and sindhusaraswati civilisation have also been employed in the literature after a posited identification of the ghaggarhakra with the river saraswati described in the early chapters of rigveda a collection of hymns in archaic sanskrit composed in the secondmillennium bce recent geophysical research suggests that unlike the sarasvati whose descriptions in the rig veda are those of a snowfed river the ghaggarhakra was a system of perennial monsoonfed rivers which became seasonal around the time that the civilisation diminished approximately 4000\\xa0years agok the indus valley civilisation was roughly contemporary with the other riverine civilisations of the ancient world ancient egypt along the nile mesopotamia in the lands watered by the euphrates and the tigris and china in the drainage basin of the yellow river and the yangtze by the time of its mature phase the civilisation had spread over an area larger than the others which included a core of 1500 kilometres 900\\xa0mi up the alluvial plain of the indus and its tributaries in addition there was a region with disparate flora fauna and habitats up to ten times as large which had been shaped culturally and economically by the indusl around 6500\\xa0bce agriculture emerged in balochistan on the margins of the indus alluviummn in the following millennia settled life made inroads into the indus plains setting the stage for the growth of rural and urban settlementso the more organized sedentary life in turn led to a net increase in the birth ratep the large urban centres of mohenjodaro and harappa very likely grew to containing between 30000 and 60000\\xa0individuals and during the civilisations florescence the population of the subcontinent grew to between 4–6\\xa0million peopleq during this period the death rate increased as the close living conditions of humans and domesticated animals led to an increase in contagious diseasesr according to one estimate the population of the indus civilisation at its peak may have been between one and five millions the civilisation extended from balochistan in the west to western uttar pradesh in the east from northeastern afghanistan in the north to gujarat state in the south the largest number of sites are in the punjab region gujarat haryana rajasthan uttar pradesh jammu and kashmir states sindh and balochistan coastal settlements extended from sutkagan dor in western baluchistan to lothal in gujarat an indus valley site has been found on the oxus river at shortugai in the gomal river valley in northwestern pakistan at manda jammu on the beas river near jammu and at alamgirpur on the hindon river only 28\\xa0km 17\\xa0mi from delhi the southernmost site of the indus valley civilisation is daimabad in maharashtra indus valley sites have been found most often on rivers but also on the ancient seacoast for example balakot kot bala and on islands for example dholavira three other scholars whose names i cannot pass over in silence are the late mr r d banerji to whom belongs the credit of having discovered if not mohenjodaro itself at any rate its high antiquity and his immediate successors in the task of excavation messrs ms vats and kn dikshit  no one probably except myself can fully appreciate the difficulties and hardships which they had to face in the three first seasons at mohenjodaro — from john marshall ed mohenjodaro and the indus civilization london arthur probsthain 1931 the first modern accounts of the ruins of the indus civilisation are those of charles masson a deserter from the east india companys army in 1829 masson traveled through the princely state of punjab gathering useful intelligence for the company in return for a promise of clemency an aspect of this arrangement was the additional requirement to hand over to the company any historical artifacts acquired during his travels masson who had versed himself in the classics especially in the military campaigns of alexander the great chose for his wanderings some of the same towns that had featured in alexanders campaigns and whose archaeological sites had been noted by the campaigns chroniclers massons major archaeological discovery in the punjab was harappa a metropolis of the indus civilisation in the valley of induss tributary the ravi river masson made copious notes and illustrations of harappas rich historical artifacts many lying halfburied in 1842 masson included his observations of harappa in the book narrative of various journeys in baluchistan afghanistan and the punjab he dated the harappa ruins to a period of recorded history erroneously mistaking it to have been described earlier during alexanders campaign masson was impressed by the sites extraordinary size and by several large mounds formed from longexisting erosiont two years later the company contracted alexander burnes to sail up the indus to assess the feasibility of water travel for its army burnes who also stopped in harappa noted the baked bricks employed in the sites ancient masonry but noted also the haphazard plundering of these bricks by the local population despite these reports harappa was raided even more perilously for its bricks after the british annexation of the punjab in 1848–49 a considerable number were carted away as track ballast for the railway lines being laid in the punjab nearly 160\\xa0km 100\\xa0mi of railway track between multan and lahore laid in the mid1850s was supported by harappan bricks in 1861 three years after the dissolution of the east india company and the establishment of crown rule in india archaeology on the subcontinent became more formally organised with the founding of the archaeological survey of india asi alexander cunningham the surveys first directorgeneral who had visited harappa in 1853 and had noted the imposing brick walls visited again to carry out a survey but this time of a site whose entire upper layer had been stripped in the interim although his original goal of demonstrating harappa to be a lost buddhist city mentioned in the seventh century ce travels of the chinese visitor xuanzang proved elusive cunningham did publish his findings in 1875 for the first time he interpreted a harappan stamp seal with its unknown script which he concluded to be of an origin foreign to india archaeological work in harappa thereafter lagged until a new viceroy of india lord curzon pushed through the ancient monuments preservation act 1904 and appointed john marshall to lead the asi several years later hiranand sastri who had been assigned by marshall to survey harappa reported it to be of nonbuddhist origin and by implication more ancient expropriating harappa for the asi under the act marshall directed asi archaeologist daya ram sahni to excavate the sites two mounds farther south along the main stem of the indus in sind province the largely undisturbed site of mohenjodaro had attracted notice marshall deputed a succession of asi officers to survey the site these included d r bhandarkar 1911 r d banerji 1919 1922–1923 and m s vats 1924 in 1923 on his second visit to mohenjodaro baneriji wrote to marshall about the site postulating an origin in remote antiquity and noting a congruence of some of its artifacts with those of harappa later in 1923 vats also in correspondence with marshall noted the same more specifically about the seals and the script found at both sites on the weight of these opinions marshall ordered crucial data from the two sites to be brought to one location and invited banerji and sahni to a joint discussion by 1924 marshall had become convinced of the significance of the finds and on 24 september 1924 made a tentative but conspicuous public intimation in the illustrated london news not often has it been given to archaeologists as it was given to schliemann at tiryns and mycenae or to stein in the deserts of turkestan to light upon the remains of a long forgotten civilisation it looks however at this moment as if we were on the threshold of such a discovery in the plains of the indus in the next issue a week later the british assyriologist archibald sayce was able to point to very similar seals found in bronze age levels in mesopotamia and iran giving the first strong indication of their date confirmations from other archaeologists followed systematic excavations began in mohenjodaro in 1924–25 with that of k n dikshit continuing with those of h hargreaves 1925–1926 and ernest j h mackay 1927–1931 by 1931 much of mohenjodaro had been excavated but occasional excavations continued such as the one led by mortimer wheeler a new directorgeneral of the asi appointed in 1944 and including ahmad hasan dani after the partition of india in 1947 when most excavated sites of the indus valley civilisation lay in territory awarded to pakistan the archaeological survey of india its area of authority reduced carried out large numbers of surveys and excavations along the ghaggarhakra system in indiau some speculated that the ghaggarhakra system might yield more sites than the indus river basin according to archaeologist ratnagar many ghaggarhakra sites in india and indus valley sites in pakistan are actually those of local cultures some sites display contact with harappan civilisation but only a few are fully developed harappan ones as of 1977  about 90 of the indus script seals and inscribed objects discovered were found at sites in pakistan along the indus river while other sites accounts only for the remaining 10v by 2002 over 1000 mature harappan cities and settlements had been reported of which just under a hundred had been excavated mainly in the general region of the indus and ghaggarhakra rivers and their tributaries however there are only five major urban sites harappa mohenjodaro dholavira ganeriwala and rakhigarhi as of 2008 about 616\\xa0sites have been reported in india whereas 406\\xa0sites have been reported in pakistan unlike india in which after 1947 the asi attempted to indianise archaeological work in keeping with the new nations goals of national unity and historical continuity in pakistan the national imperative was the promotion of islamic heritage and consequently archaeological work on early sites was left to foreign archaeologists after the partition mortimer wheeler the director of asi from 1944 oversaw the establishment of archaeological institutions in pakistan later joining a unesco effort tasked to conserve the site at mohenjodaro other international efforts at mohenjodaro and harappa have included the german aachen research project mohenjodaro the italian mission to mohenjodaro and the us harappa archaeological research project harp founded by george f dales following a chance flash flood which exposed a portion of an archaeological site at the foot of the bolan pass in balochistan excavations were carried out in mehrgarh by french archaeologist jeanfrançois jarrige and his team in the early 1970s the cities of the ancient indus had social hierarchies their writing system their large planned cities and their longdistance trade which mark them to archaeologists as a fullfledged civilisation the mature phase of the harappan civilisation lasted from c\\u20092600–1900\\xa0bce with the inclusion of the predecessor and successor cultures – early harappan and late harappan respectively – the entire indus valley civilisation may be taken to have lasted from the 33rd to the 14th\\xa0centuries bce it is part of the indus valley tradition which also includes the preharappan occupation of mehrgarh the earliest farming site of the indus valley several periodisations are employed for the ivc the most commonly used classifies the indus valley civilisation into early mature and late harappan phase an alternative approach by shaffer divides the broader indus valley tradition into four eras the preharappan early food producing era and the regionalisation integration and localisation eras which correspond roughly with the early harappan mature harappan and late harappan phases mehrgarh is a neolithic 7000\\xa0bce to c\\u20092500\\xa0bce mountain site in the balochistan province of pakistan which gave new insights on the emergence of the indus valley civilisationw mehrgarh is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in south asia mehrgarh was influenced by the near eastern neolithic with similarities between domesticated wheat varieties early phases of farming pottery other archaeological artefacts some domesticated plants and herd animalsx jeanfrancois jarrige argues for an independent origin of mehrgarh jarrige notes the assumption that farming economy was introduced fullfledged from neareast to south asiaxyz and the similarities between neolithic sites from eastern mesopotamia and the western indus valley which are evidence of a cultural continuum between those sites but given the originality of mehrgarh jarrige concludes that mehrgarh has an earlier local background and is not a backwater of the neolithic culture of the near east lukacs and hemphill suggest an initial local development of mehrgarh with a continuity in cultural development but a change in population according to lukacs and hemphill while there is a strong continuity between the neolithic and chalcolithic copper age cultures of mehrgarh dental evidence shows that the chalcolithic population did not descend from the neolithic population of mehrgarh which suggests moderate levels of gene flowaa mascarenhas et al 2015 note that new possibly west asian body types are reported from the graves of mehrgarh beginning in the togau phase 3800\\xa0bce gallego romero et al 2011 state that their research on lactose tolerance in india suggests that the west eurasian genetic contribution identified by reich et al 2009 principally reflects gene flow from iran and the middle east they further note that the earliest evidence of cattle herding in south asia comes from the indus river valley site of mehrgarh and is dated to 7000\\xa0ybpab the early harappan ravi phase named after the nearby ravi river lasted from c\\u20093300 bce until 2800\\xa0bce it started when farmers from the mountains gradually moved between their mountain homes and the lowland river valleys and is related to the hakra phase identified in the ghaggarhakra river valley to the west and predates the kot diji phase 2800–2600\\xa0bce harappan\\xa02 named after a site in northern sindh pakistan near mohenjodaro the earliest examples of the indus script date to the 3rd\\xa0millennium bce the mature phase of earlier village cultures is represented by rehman dheri and amri in pakistan kot diji represents the phase leading up to mature harappan with the citadel representing centralised authority and an increasingly urban quality of life another town of this stage was found at kalibangan in india on the hakra river trade networks linked this culture with related regional cultures and distant sources of raw materials including lapis lazuli and other materials for beadmaking by this time villagers had domesticated numerous crops including peas sesame seeds dates and cotton as well as animals including the water buffalo early harappan communities turned to large urban centres by 2600 bce from where the mature harappan phase started the latest research shows that indus valley people migrated from villages to cities the final stages of the early harappan period are characterised by the building of large walled settlements the expansion of trade networks and the increasing integration of regional communities into a relatively uniform material culture in terms of pottery styles ornaments and stamp seals with indus script leading into the transition to the mature harappan phase according to giosan et al 2012 the slow southward migration of the monsoons across asia initially allowed the indus valley villages to develop by taming the floods of the indus and its tributaries floodsupported farming led to large agricultural surpluses which in turn supported the development of cities the ivc residents did not develop irrigation capabilities relying mainly on the seasonal monsoons leading to summer floods brooke further notes that the development of advanced cities coincides with a reduction in rainfall which may have triggered a reorganisation into larger urban centrese according to jg shaffer and da lichtenstein the mature harappan civilisation was a fusion of the bagor hakra and kot diji traditions or ethnic groups in the ghaggarhakra valley on the borders of india and pakistan also according to a more recent summary by maisels 2003 the harappan oecumene formed from a kot dijianamrinal synthesis he also says that in the development of complexity the site of mohenjodaro has priority along with the hakraghaggar cluster of sites where hakra wares actually precede the kot diji related material he sees these areas as catalytic in producing the fusion from hakra kot dijian and amrinal cultural elements that resulted in the gestalt we recognize as early harappan early indus by 2600 bce the early harappan communities turned into large urban centres such urban centres include harappa ganeriwala mohenjodaro in modernday pakistan and dholavira kalibangan rakhigarhi rupar and lothal in modernday india in total more than 1000\\xa0settlements have been found mainly in the general region of the indus and ghaggarhakra rivers and their tributaries a sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture is evident in the indus valley civilisation making them the first urban centre in the region the quality of municipal town planning suggests the knowledge of urban planning and efficient municipal governments which placed a high priority on hygiene or alternatively accessibility to the means of religious ritual as seen in harappa mohenjodaro and the recently partially excavated rakhigarhi this urban plan included the worlds first known urban sanitation systems within the city individual homes or groups of homes obtained water from wells from a room that appears to have been set aside for bathing waste water was directed to covered drains which lined the major streets houses opened only to inner courtyards and smaller lanes the housebuilding in some villages in the region still resembles in some respects the housebuilding of the harappansac the ancient indus systems of sewerage and drainage that were developed and used in cities throughout the indus region were far more advanced than any found in contemporary urban sites in the middle east and even more efficient than those in many areas of pakistan and india today the advanced architecture of the harappans is shown by their dockyards granaries warehouses brick platforms and protective walls the massive walls of indus cities most likely protected the harappans from floods and may have dissuaded military conflicts the purpose of the citadel remains debated in sharp contrast to this civilisations contemporaries mesopotamia and ancient egypt no large monumental structures were built there is no conclusive evidence of palaces or temples some structures are thought to have been granaries found at one city is an enormous wellbuilt bath the great bath which may have been a public bath although the citadels were walled it is far from clear that these structures were defensive most city dwellers appear to have been traders or artisans who lived with others pursuing the same occupation in welldefined neighbourhoods materials from distant regions were used in the cities for constructing seals beads and other objects among the artefacts discovered were beautiful glazed faïence beads steatite seals have images of animals people perhaps gods and other types of inscriptions including the yet undeciphered writing system of the indus valley civilisation some of the seals were used to stamp clay on trade goods although some houses were larger than others indus civilisation cities were remarkable for their apparent if relative egalitarianism all the houses had access to water and drainage facilities this gives the impression of a society with relatively low wealth concentration archaeological records provide no immediate answers for a centre of power or for depictions of people in power in harappan society but there are indications of complex decisions being taken and implemented for instance the majority of the cities were constructed in a highly uniform and wellplanned grid pattern suggesting they were planned by a central authority extraordinary uniformity of harappan artefacts as evident in pottery seals weights and bricks presence of public facilities and monumental architecture heterogeneity in the mortuary symbolism and in grave goods items included in burialscitation needed these are some major theoriescitation needed harappans evolved some new techniques in metallurgy and produced copper bronze lead and tincitation needed a touchstone bearing gold streaks was found in banawali which was probably used for testing the purity of gold such a technique is still used in some parts of india the people of the indus civilisation achieved great accuracy in measuring length mass and time they were among the first to develop a system of uniform weights and measuresdubious  – discuss a comparison of available objects indicates large scale variation across the indus territories their smallest division which is marked on an ivory scale found in lothal in gujarat was approximately 1704\\xa0mm the smallest division ever recorded on a scale of the bronze agecitation needed harappan engineers followed the decimal division of measurement for all practical purposes including the measurement of mass as revealed by their hexahedron weightscitation needed these chert weights were in a ratio of 521 with weights of 005 01 02 05 1 2 5 10 20 50 100 200 and 500\\xa0units with each unit weighing approximately 28\\xa0grams similar to the english imperial ounce or greek uncia and smaller objects were weighed in similar ratios with the units of 0871\\xa0 however as in other cultures actual weights were not uniform throughout the area the weights and measures later used in kautilyas arthashastra 4th\\xa0century bce are the same as those used in lothal many indus valley seals and items in pottery and terracotta have been found along with a very few stone sculptures and some gold jewellery and bronze vessels some anatomically detailed figurines in terracotta bronze and steatite have been found at excavation sites the former probably mostly toys the harappans also made various toys and games among them cubical dice with one to six holes on the faces which were found in sites like mohenjodaro the terracotta figurines included cows bears monkeys and dogs the animal depicted on a majority of seals at sites of the mature period has not been clearly identified part bull part zebra with a majestic horn it has been a source of speculation as yet there is insufficient evidence to substantiate claims that the image had religious or cultic significance but the prevalence of the image raises the question of whether or not the animals in images of the ivc are religious symbols many crafts including shell working ceramics and agate and glazed steatite bead making were practised and the pieces were used in the making of necklaces bangles and other ornaments from all phases of harappan culture some of these crafts are still practised in the subcontinent today some makeup and toiletry items a special kind of combs kakai the use of collyrium and a special threeinone toiletry gadget that were found in harappan contexts still have similar counterparts in modern india terracotta female figurines were found c\\u20092800–2600\\xa0bce which had red colour applied to the manga line of partition of the hair the finds from mohenjodaro were initially deposited in the lahore museum but later moved to the asi headquarters at new delhi where a new central imperial museum was being planned for the new capital of the british raj in which at least a selection would be displayed it became apparent that indian independence was approaching but the partition of india was not anticipated until late in the process the new pakistani authorities requested the return of the mohenjodaro pieces excavated on their territory but the indian authorities refused eventually an agreement was reached whereby the finds totalling some 12000 objects most sherds of pottery were split equally between the countries in some cases this was taken very literally with some necklaces and girdles having their beads separated into two piles in the case of the two most celebrated sculpted figures pakistan asked for and received the socalled priestking figure while india retained the much smaller dancing girl though written considerably later the arts treatise natya shastra c\\u2009200 bce – 200 ce classifies musical instruments into four groups based on their means of acoustical production—strings membranes solid materials and air—and it is probable that such instruments had existed since the ivc archeological evidence indicates the use of simple rattles and vessel flutes while iconographical evidence suggests early harps and drums were also used an ideogram in the ivc contains the earliest known depiction of an arched harp dated sometime before 1800 bce ceremonial vessel 2600–2450\\xa0bc terracotta with black paint 4953 × 254\\xa0cm

is the lostwax casting bronze statuette of a slenderlimbed dancing girl adorned with bangles found in mohenjodaro two other realistic incomplete statuettes have been found in harappa in proper stratified excavations which display nearclassical treatment of the human shape the statuette of a dancer who seems to be male and the hapappa torso a red jasper male torso both now in the delhi national museum sir john marshall reacted with surprise when he saw these two statuettes from harappa when i first saw them i found it difficult to believe that they were prehistoric they seemed to completely upset all established ideas about early art and culture modelling such as this was unknown in the ancient world up to the hellenistic age of greece and i thought therefore that some mistake must surely have been made that these figures had found their way into levels some 3000\\xa0years older than those to which they properly belonged  now in these statuettes it is just this anatomical truth which is so startling that makes us wonder whether in this allimportant matter greek artistry could possibly have been anticipated by the sculptors of a faroff age on the banks of the indus these statuettes remain controversial due to their advanced style in representing the human body regarding the red jasper torso the discoverer vats claims a harappan date but marshall considered this statuette is probably historical dating to the gupta period comparing it to the much later lohanipur torso  a second rather similar grey stone torso of a dancing male was also found about 150\\xa0meters away in a secure mature harappan stratum overall anthropologist gregory possehl tends to consider that these statuettes probably form the pinnacle of indus art during the mature

painted on the first page of constitution of india the indus valley civilisation may have had bullock carts identical to those seen throughout south asia today as well as boats most of these boats were probably small flatbottomed craft perhaps driven by sail similar to those one can see on the indus river today  an extensive canal network used for irrigation has however also been discovered by hp francfort during 4300–3200\\xa0bce of the chalcolithic period copper age the indus valley civilisation area shows ceramic similarities with southern turkmenistan and northern iran which suggest considerable mobility and trade during the early harappan period about 3200–2600\\xa0bce similarities in pottery seals figurines ornaments etc document intensive caravan trade with central asia and the iranian plateau judging from the dispersal of indus civilisation artefacts the trade networks economically integrated a huge area including portions of afghanistan the coastal regions of persia northern and western india and mesopotamia leading to the development of indusmesopotamia relations studies of tooth enamel from individuals buried at harappa suggest that some residents had migrated to the city from beyond the indus valley  ancient dna studies of graves at bronze age sites at gonur depe turkmenistan and shahre sukhteh iran have identified 11 individuals of south asian descent who are presumed to be of mature indus valley origin there was an extensive maritime trade network operating between the harappan and mesopotamian civilisations as early as the middle harappan phase with much commerce being handled by middlemen merchants from dilmun modern bahrain eastern arabia and failaka located in the persian gulf such longdistance sea trade became feasible with the development of plankbuilt watercraft equipped with a single central mast supporting a sail of woven rushes or cloth however the evidence of seaborne trade involving the harappan civilisation is not firm in their book rise of civilization in india and pakistan archaeologists bridget allchin and raymond allchin write  p 173 the settlement at lothal  along the east side was a brick basin it is claimed by its excavator to have been a dockyard connected by channels to a neighbouring estuary  on its edge the excavator discovered several heavilypierced stones similar to modern anchor stones employed by traditional seafaring communities of western india this interpretation however has been challenged and indeed the published levels of the basin and its entrance relative to the modern sea level seem to argue against it leshnik has cogently suggested that it was a tank for the reception of sweet water channelled from higher ground inland to an area where the local water supplies were anciently as still today saline  we regard either interpretation as still unproven but favour the latter  p 188–189 the discussion of trade focuses attention upon methods of transport  several representations of ships are found on seals and graffiti at harappa mohenjodaro figs 715–716 etc and a terracotta model of a ship with a stick impressed socket for the mast and eyeholes for fixing rigging comes from lothal  we have already seen above that the great brick tank interpreted by rao as a dock at lothal cannot yet be certainly identified the evidence of sea trade and contact during the harappan period is largely circumstantial or derived from inferences from the mesopotamian texts as detailed above figure 7 15 had caption mohenjodaro representation of ship on a stone seal length 43 cm after mackay  figure 716 mohenjodaro representation of ship on terracotta amulet length 45 cm after dales daniel t potts writes it is generally assumed that most trade between the indus valley ancient meluhha and western neighbors proceeded up the persian gulf rather than overland although there is no incontrovertible proof that this was indeed the case the distribution of industype artifacts on the oman peninsula on bahrain and in southern mesopotamia makes it plausible that a series of maritime stages linked the indus valley and the gulf region if this is accepted then the presence of etched carnelian beads a harappanstyle cubical stone weight and a harappanstyle cylinder seal at susa amiet 1986a figs 9294 may be evidence of maritime trade between susa and the indus valley in the late 3rd millennium bce on the other hand given that similar finds particularly etched carnelian beads are attested at landlocked sites including tepe hissar tappe heṣār shah tepe šāhtappe kalleh nisar kalla nisār jalalabad jalālābād marlik mārlik and tepe yahya tappe yaḥyā possehl 1996 pp 15354 other mechanisms including overland traffic by peddlers or caravans may account for their presence at susa in the 1980s important archaeological discoveries were made at ras aljinz oman demonstrating maritime indus valley connections with the arabian peninsula according to gangal et al 2014 there is strong archeological and geographical evidence that neolithic farming spread from the near east into northwest india but there is also good evidence for the local domestication of barley and the zebu cattle at mehrgarhad according to jeanfrancois jarrige farming had an independent local origin at mehrgarh which he argues is not merely a backwater of the neolithic culture of the near east despite similarities between neolithic sites from eastern mesopotamia and the western indus valley which are evidence of a cultural continuum between those sites archaeologist jim g shaffer writes that the mehrgarh site demonstrates that food production was an indigenous south asian phenomenon and that the data support interpretation of the prehistoric urbanisation and complex social organisation in south asia as based on indigenous but not isolated cultural developments jarrige notes that the people of mehrgarh used domesticated wheats and barley while shaffer and liechtenstein note that the major cultivated cereal crop was naked sixrow barley a crop derived from tworow barley gangal agrees that neolithic domesticated crops in mehrgarh include more than 90 barley noting that there is good evidence for the local domestication of barley yet gangal also notes that the crop also included a small amount of wheat which are suggested to be of neareastern origin as the modern distribution of wild varieties of wheat is limited to northern levant and southern turkeyae the cattle that are often portrayed on indus seals are humped indian aurochs bos primigenius namadicus which are similar to zebu cattle zebu cattle is still common in india and in africa it is different from the european cattle bos primigenius taurus and are believed to have been independently domesticated on the indian subcontinent probably in the baluchistan region of pakistanad research by j bates et al 2016 confirms that indus populations were the earliest people to use complex multicropping strategies across both seasons growing foods during summer rice millets and beans and winter wheat barley and pulses which required different watering regimes bates et al 2016 also found evidence for an entirely separate domestication process of rice in ancient south asia based around the wild species oryza nivara this led to the local development of a mix of wetland and dryland agriculture of local oryza sativa indica rice agriculture before the truly wetland rice oryza sativa japonica arrived around 2000 bce according to archeological finds indus valley civilization had dominance of meat diet of animals such as cattle buffalo goat pig and chicken remnants of dairy products were also discovered according to akshyeta suryanarayan et alaf available evidence indicates culinary practices to be common over the region foodconstituents were dairy products in low proportion ruminant carcass meat and either nonruminant adipose fats plants or mixtures of these products the dietary pattern remained same throughout the decline seven foodballs laddus were found in intact form along with two figurines of bulls and a handheld copper adze during excavations in 2017 from western rajasthan dated to about 2600 bce they were likely composed of legumes primarily mung and cereals the authors speculated the foodballs to be of a ritualistic significance given the finds of bull figurines adze and a seal in immediate vicinity it has often been suggested that the bearers of the ivc corresponded to protodravidians linguistically the breakup of protodravidian corresponding to the breakup of the late harappan culture finnish indologist asko parpola concludes that the uniformity of the indus inscriptions precludes any possibility of widely different languages being used and that an early form of dravidian language must have been the language of the indus people today the dravidian language family is concentrated mostly in southern india and northern and eastern sri lanka but pockets of it still remain throughout the rest of india and pakistan the brahui language which lends credence to the theory according to heggarty and renfrew dravidian languages may have spread into the indian subcontinent with the spread of farming according to david mcalpin the dravidian languages were brought to india by immigration into india from elamag in earlier publications renfrew also stated that protodravidian was brought to india by farmers from the iranian part of the fertile crescentah but more recently heggarty and renfrew note that a great deal remains to be done in elucidating the prehistory of dravidian they also note that mcalpins analysis of the language data and thus his claims remain far from orthodoxy heggarty and renfrew conclude that several scenarios are compatible with the data and that the linguistic jury is still very much outaj in a 2021 study bahata ansumali mukhopadhyay presented a linguistic analysis to posit a protodravidian presence in the ancient indus area using dravidian root words for tooth toothbrush and elephant in various contemporary ancient civilisations between 400 and as many as 600\\xa0distinct indus symbols have been found on stamp seals small tablets ceramic pots and more than a dozen other materials including a signboard that apparently once hung over the gate of the inner citadel of the indus city of dholavira typical indus inscriptions are around five characters in length most of which aside from the dholavira signboard are tiny the longest on any single object inscribed on a copper plate has a length of 34\\xa0symbols while the indus valley civilisation is generally characterised as a literate society on the evidence of these inscriptions this description has been challenged by farmer sproat and witzel 2004 who argue that the indus system did not encode language but was instead similar to a variety of nonlinguistic sign systems used extensively in the near east and other societies to symbolise families clans gods and religious concepts others have claimed on occasion that the symbols were exclusively used for economic transactions but this claim leaves unexplained the appearance of indus symbols on many ritual objects many of which were massproduced in moulds no parallels to these massproduced inscriptions are known in any other early ancient civilisations in a 2009 study by pn rao et al published in science computer scientists comparing the pattern of symbols to various linguistic scripts and nonlinguistic systems including dna and a computer programming language found that the indus scripts pattern is closer to that of spoken words supporting the hypothesis that it codes for an asyetunknown language farmer sproat and witzel have disputed this finding pointing out that rao et al did not actually compare the indus signs with realworld nonlinguistic systems but rather with two wholly artificial systems invented by the authors one consisting of 200000\\xa0randomly ordered signs and another of 200000\\xa0fully ordered signs that they spuriously claim represent the structures of all realworld nonlinguistic sign systems farmer et al have also demonstrated that a comparison of a nonlinguistic system like medieval heraldic signs with natural languages yields results similar to those that rao et al obtained with indus signs they conclude that the method used by rao et al cannot distinguish linguistic systems from nonlinguistic ones the messages on the seals have proved to be too short to be decoded by a computer each seal has a distinctive combination of symbols and there are too few examples of each sequence to provide a sufficient context the symbols that accompany the images vary from seal to seal making it impossible to derive a meaning for the symbols from the images there have nonetheless been a number of interpretations offered for the meaning of the seals these interpretations have been marked by ambiguity and subjectivity\\u200a69 photos of many of the thousands of extant inscriptions are published in the corpus of indus seals and inscriptions 1987 1991 2010 edited by asko parpola and his colleagues the most recent volume republished photos taken in the 1920s and 1930s of hundreds of lost or stolen inscriptions along with many discovered in the last few decades formerly researchers had to supplement the materials in the corpus by study of the tiny photos in the excavation reports of marshall 1931 mackay 1938 1943 wheeler 1947 or reproductions in more recent scattered sourcescitation needed the religion and belief system of the indus valley people has received considerable attention especially from the view of identifying precursors to deities and religious practices of indian religions that later developed in the area however due to the sparsity of evidence which is open to varying interpretations and the fact that the indus script remains undeciphered the conclusions are partly speculative and largely based on a retrospective view from a much later hindu perspective early and influential work in the area that set the trend for hindu interpretations of archaeological evidence from the harappan sites was that of john marshall who in 1931 identified the following as prominent features of the indus religion a great male god and a mother goddess deification or veneration of animals and plants a symbolic representation of the phallus linga and vulva yoni and use of baths and water in religious practice marshalls interpretations have been much debated and sometimes disputed over the following decades one indus valley seal shows a seated figure with a horned headdress possibly tricephalic and possibly ithyphallic surrounded by animals marshall identified the figure as an early form of the hindu god shiva or rudra who is associated with asceticism yoga and linga regarded as a lord of animals and often depicted as having three eyes the seal has hence come to be known as the pashupati seal after pashupati lord of all animals an epithet of shiva while marshalls work has earned some support many critics and even supporters have raised several objections doris srinivasan has argued that the figure does not have three faces or yogic posture and that in vedic literature rudra was not a protector of wild animals herbert sullivan and alf hiltebeitel also rejected marshalls conclusions with the former claiming that the figure was female while the latter associated the figure with mahisha the buffalo god and the surrounding animals with vahanas vehicles of deities for the four cardinal directions writing in 2002 gregory l possehl concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognise the figure as a deity its association with the water buffalo and its posture as one of ritual discipline regarding it as a protoshiva would be going too far despite the criticisms of marshalls association of the seal with a protoshiva icon it has been interpreted as the tirthankara rishabhanatha by some scholars of jainism like vilas sangave historians such as heinrich zimmer and thomas mcevilley believe that there is a connection between first jain tirthankara rishabhanatha and the indus valley civilisation marshall hypothesised the existence of a cult of mother goddess worship based upon excavation of several female figurines and thought that this was a precursor of the hindu sect of shaktism however the function of the female figurines in the life of indus valley people remains unclear and possehl does not regard the evidence for marshalls hypothesis to be terribly robust some of the baetyls interpreted by marshall to be sacred phallic representations are now thought to have been used as pestles or game counters instead while the ring stones that were thought to symbolise yoni were determined to be architectural features used to stand pillars although the possibility of their religious symbolism cannot be eliminated many indus valley seals show animals with some depicting them being carried in processions while others show chimeric creations one seal from mohenjodaro shows a halfhuman a halfbuffalo monster attacking a tiger which may be a reference to the sumerian myth of such a monster created by goddess aruru to fight gilgamesh in contrast to contemporary egyptian and mesopotamian civilisations indus valley lacks any monumental palaces even though excavated cities indicate that the society possessed the requisite engineering knowledge this may suggest that religious ceremonies if any may have been largely confined to individual homes small temples or the open air several sites have been proposed by marshall and later scholars as possibly devoted to religious purposes but at present only the great bath at mohenjodaro is widely thought to have been so used as a place for ritual purification the funerary practices of the harappan civilisation are marked by fractional burial in which the body is reduced to skeletal remains by exposure to the elements before final interment and even cremation around 1900\\xa0bce signs of a gradual decline began to emerge and by around 1700 bce most of the cities had been abandoned recent examination of human skeletons from the site of harappa has demonstrated that the end of the indus civilisation saw an increase in interpersonal violence and in infectious diseases like leprosy and tuberculosis according to historian upinder singh the general picture presented by the late harappan phase is one of a breakdown of urban networks and an expansion of rural ones during the period of approximately 1900 to 1700 bce multiple regional cultures emerged within the area of the indus civilisation the cemetery h culture was in punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh the jhukar culture was in sindh and the rangpur culture characterised by lustrous red ware pottery was in gujarat other sites associated with the late phase of the harappan culture are pirak in balochistan pakistan and daimabad in maharashtra india the largest late harappan sites are kudwala in cholistan bet dwarka in gujarat and daimabad in maharashtra which can be considered as urban but they are smaller and few in number compared with the mature harappan cities bet dwarka was fortified and continued to have contacts with the persian gulf region but there was a general decrease of longdistance trade on the other hand the period also saw a diversification of the agricultural base with a diversity of crops and the advent of doublecropping as well as a shift of rural settlement towards the east and the south the pottery of the late harappan period is described as showing some continuity with mature harappan pottery traditions but also distinctive differences many sites continued to be occupied for some centuries although their urban features declined and disappeared formerly typical artifacts such as stone weights and female figurines became rare there are some circular stamp seals with geometric designs but lacking the indus script which characterised the mature phase of the civilisation script is rare and confined to potsherd inscriptions there was also a decline in longdistance trade although the local cultures show new innovations in faience and glass making and carving of stone beads urban amenities such as drains and the public bath were no longer maintained and newer buildings were poorly constructed stone sculptures were deliberately vandalised valuables were sometimes concealed in hoards suggesting unrest and the corpses of animals and even humans were left unburied in the streets and in abandoned buildings during the later half of the 2nd\\xa0millennium bce most of the posturban late harappan settlements were abandoned altogether subsequent material culture was typically characterised by temporary occupation the campsites of a population which was nomadic and mainly pastoralist and which used crude handmade pottery however there is greater continuity and overlap between late harappan and subsequent cultural phases at sites in punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh primarily small rural settlements in 1953 sir mortimer wheeler proposed that the invasion of an indoeuropean tribe from central asia the aryans caused the decline of the indus civilisation as evidence he cited a group of 37 skeletons found in various parts of mohenjodaro and passages in the vedas referring to battles and forts however scholars soon started to reject wheelers theory since the skeletons belonged to a period after the citys abandonment and none were found near the citadel subsequent examinations of the skeletons by kenneth kennedy in 1994 showed that the marks on the skulls were caused by erosion and not by violence in the cemetery h culture the late harappan phase in the punjab region some of the designs painted on the funerary urns have been interpreted through the lens of vedic literature for instance peacocks with hollow bodies and a small human form inside which has been interpreted as the souls of the dead and a hound that can be seen as the hound of yama the god of death this may indicate the introduction of new religious beliefs during this period but the archaeological evidence does not support the hypothesis that the cemetery h people were the destroyers of the harappan cities suggested contributory causes for the localisation of the ivc include changes in the course of the river and climate change that is also signaled for the neighboring areas of the middle east as of 2016update many scholars believe that drought and a decline in trade with egypt and mesopotamia caused the collapse of the indus civilisation the climate change which caused the collapse of the indus valley civilisation was possibly due to an abrupt and critical megadrought and cooling 4200\\xa0years ago which marks the onset of the meghalayan age the present stage of the holocene the ghaggarhakra system was rainfedakal and watersupply depended on the monsoons the indus valley climate grew significantly cooler and drier from about 1800\\xa0bce linked to a general weakening of the monsoon at that time the indian monsoon declined and aridity increased with the ghaggarhakra retracting its reach towards the foothills of the himalaya leading to erratic and less extensive floods that made inundation agriculture less sustainable aridification reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisations demise and scatter its population eastwarde according to giosan et al 2012 the ivc residents did not develop irrigation capabilities relying mainly on the seasonal monsoons leading to summer floods as the monsoons kept shifting south the floods grew too erratic for sustainable agricultural activities the residents then migrated towards the ganges basin in the east where they established smaller villages and isolated farms the small surplus produced in these small communities did not allow the development of trade and the cities died out archaeological excavations indicate that the decline of harappa drove people eastward according to possehl after 1900\\xa0bce the number of sites in todays india increased from 218 to 853 according to andrew lawler excavations along the gangetic plain show that cities began to arise there starting about 1200\\xa0bce just a few centuries after harappa was deserted and much earlier than once suspectedam according to jim shaffer there was a continuous series of cultural developments just as in most areas of the world these link the socalled two major phases of urbanisation in south asia at sites such as bhagwanpura in haryana archaeological excavations have discovered an overlap between the final phase of late harappan pottery and the earliest phase of painted grey ware pottery the latter being associated with the vedic culture and dating from around 1200\\xa0bce this site provides evidence of multiple social groups occupying the same village but using different pottery and living in different types of houses over time the late harappan pottery was gradually replaced by painted grey ware pottery and other cultural changes indicated by archaeology include the introduction of the horse iron tools and new religious practices there is also a harappan site called rojdi in rajkot district of saurashtra its excavation started under an archaeological team from gujarat state department of archaeology and the museum of the university of pennsylvania in 1982–83 in their report on archaeological excavations at rojdi gregory possehl and mh raval write that although there are obvious signs of cultural continuity between the harappan civilisation and later south asian cultures many aspects of the harappan sociocultural system and integrated civilization were lost forever while the second urbanisation of india beginning with the northern black polished ware culture c\\u2009600\\xa0bce lies well outside this sociocultural environment previously scholars believed that the decline of the harappan civilisation led to an interruption of urban life in the indian subcontinent however the indus valley civilisation did not disappear suddenly and many elements of the indus civilisation appear in later cultures the cemetery h culture may be the manifestation of the late harappan over a large area in the region of punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh and the ochre coloured pottery culture its successor david gordon white cites three other mainstream scholars who have emphatically demonstrated that vedic religion derives partially from the indus valley civilisations as of 2016update archaeological data suggests that the material culture classified as late harappan may have persisted until at least c\\u20091000–900\\xa0bce and was partially contemporaneous with the painted grey ware culture harvard archaeologist richard meadow points to the late harappan settlement of pirak which thrived continuously from 1800 bce to the time of the invasion of alexander the great in 325\\xa0bce in the aftermath of the indus civilisations localisation regional cultures emerged to varying degrees showing the influence of the indus civilisation in the formerly great city of harappa burials have been found that correspond to a regional culture called the cemetery h culture at the same time the ochre coloured pottery culture expanded from rajasthan into the gangetic plain the cemetery h culture has the earliest evidence for cremation a practice dominant in hinduism today the inhabitants of the indus valley civilisation migrated from the river valleys of indus and ghaggarhakra towards the himalayan foothills of the gangayamuna basin the world economic forum wef is an international nongovernmental and lobbying organisation for multinational companies based in cologny canton of geneva switzerland it was founded on 24 january 1971 by german engineer klaus schwab the foundation which is mostly funded by its 1000 member companies – typically global enterprises with more than us5 billion in turnover – as well as public subsidiescitation needed views its own mission as improving the state of the world by engaging business political academic and other leaders of society to shape global regional and industry agendas the wef is mostly known for its annual meeting at the end of january in davos a mountain resort in the eastern alps region of switzerland the meeting brings together some 3000 paying members and selected participants – among whom are investors business leaders political leaders economists celebrities and journalists – for up to five days to discuss global issues across 500 sessions aside from davos the organization convenes regional conferences in locations across africa east asia latin america and india and holds two additional annual meetings in china and the united arab emirates it furthermore produces a series of reports engages its members in sectorspecific initiatives and provides a platform for leaders from selected stakeholder groups to collaborate on projects and initiatives the forum suggests that a globalised world is best managed by a selfselected coalition of multinational corporations governments and civil society organizations csos which it expresses through initiatives like the great reset and the global redesign the world economic forum and its annual meeting in davos have received criticism over the years including the organizations corporate capture of global and democratic institutions its institutional whitewashing initiatives the public cost of security the organizations taxexempt status unclear decision processes and membership criteria a lack of financial transparency and the environmental footprint of its annual meetings as a reaction to criticism within swiss society the swiss federal government decided in february 2021 to reduce its annual contributions to the wef the cost to be paid by companies for a delegate to the wef were us70000 in the early 2000 years and in 2022 were us120000  the wef was founded in 1971 by klaus schwab a business professor at the university of geneva first named the european management forum it changed its name to the world economic forum in 1987 and sought to broaden its vision to include providing a platform for resolving international conflicts in february 1971 schwab invited 450 executives from western european firms to the first european management symposium held in the davos congress centre under the patronage of the european commission and european industrial associations where schwab sought to introduce european firms to american management practices he then founded the wef as a nonprofit organization based in geneva and drew european business leaders to davos for the annual meetings each january the second european management forum in 1972 was the first meeting at which one of the speakers at the forum was a head of government president pierre werner of luxembourg events in 1973 including the collapse of the bretton woods fixedexchange rate mechanism and the yom kippur war saw the annual meeting expand its focus from management to economic and social issues and for the first time political leaders were invited to the annual meeting in january 1974 through the forums first decade it maintained a playful atmosphere with many members skiing and participating in evening events appraising the 1981 event one attendee noted that the forum offers a delightful vacation on the expense account political leaders soon began to use the annual meeting as venue for promoting their interests the davos declaration was signed in 1988 by greece and turkey helping them turn back from the brink of war in 1992 south african president f w de klerk met with nelson mandela and chief mangosuthu buthelezi at the annual meeting their first joint appearance outside south africa at the 1994 annual meeting israeli foreign minister shimon peres and plo chairman yasser arafat reached a draft agreement on gaza and jericho in october 2004 the world economic forum gained attention through the resignation of its ceo and executive director josé maría figueres over the undeclared receipt of more than us900000 in consultancy fees from the french telecommunications firm alcatel transparency international highlighted this incident in their global corruption report two years later in 2006 in january 2006 the wef published an article in its global agenda magazine titled boycott israel which was distributed to all 2340 participants of the annual meeting following the publication klaus schwab described the publication as an unacceptable failure in the editorial process in late 2015 the invitation was extended to include a north korean delegation for the 2016 wef in view of positive signs coming out of the country the wef organizers noted north korea has not been attending the wef since 1998 the invitation was accepted however wef revoked the invitation on 13 january 2016 after the 6 january 2016 north korean nuclear test and the countrys attendance was made subject to existing and possible forthcoming sanctions despite protests by north korea calling the decision by the wef managing board a sudden and irresponsible move the wef committee maintained the exclusion because under these circumstances there would be no opportunity for international dialogue in 2017 the wef in davos attracted considerable attention when for the first time a head of state from the peoples republic of china was present at the alpine resort with the backdrop of brexit an incoming protectionist us administration and significant pressures on free trade zones and trade agreements paramount leader xi jinping defended the global economic scheme and portrayed china as a responsible nation and a leader for environmental causes he sharply rebuked the current populist movements that would introduce tariffs and hinder global commerce warning that such protectionism could foster isolation and reduced economic opportunity in 2018 indian prime minister narendra modi gave the keynote speech becoming the first head of government from india to deliver the inaugural keynote for the annual plenary at davos modi highlighted global warming climate change terrorism and protectionism as the three major global challenges and expressed confidence that they can be tackled with collective effort in 2019 brazilian president jair bolsonaro gave the keynote address at the plenary session of the conference on his first international trip to davos he emphasized liberal economic policies despite his populist agenda and attempted to reassure the world that brazil is a protector of the rain forest while utilizing its resources for food production and export he stated that his government will seek to better integrate brazil into the world by mainstreaming international best practices such as those adopted and promoted by the oecd environmental concerns like extreme weather events and the failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation were among the topranking global risks expressed by wef attendees on june 13 2019 the wef and the united nations signed a strategic partnership framework in order to jointly accelerate the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the 2021 world economic forum was due to be held from 17 to 20 august in singapore however on 17 may the forum was cancelled with a new meeting to take place in the first half of 2022 instead with a final location and date to be determined later in 2021 in late december 2021 the world economic forum said in a release that pandemic conditions had made it extremely difficult to stage a global inperson meeting the following month transmissibility of the sarscov2 omicron variant and its impact on travel and mobility had made deferral necessary in early 2022 the annual meeting in davos was rescheduled for 22 to 26 may 2022 its themes include the russoukrainian war climate change energy insecurity and inflation ukraines president volodymyr zelenskyy gave a special address at the meeting thanking the global community for its efforts but also calling for more support the 2022 forum was marked by the absence of a russian delegation for the first time since 1991 which the wall street journal described as signalling the unraveling of globalization the former russia house was used to present russias war crimes the 2023 annual meeting of the world economic forum took place in davos switzerland from 16–20 january under the motto cooperation in a fragmented world headquartered in cologny the wef also has offices in new york beijing and tokyo in january 2015 it was designated an ngo with other international body status by the swiss federal government under the swiss hoststate act on 10 october 2016 the wef announced the opening of its new center for the fourth industrial revolution in san francisco according to the wef the center will serve as a platform for interaction insight and impact on the scientific and technological changes that are changing the way we live work and relate to one another the world economic forum claims to be impartial and that it is not tied to any political partisan or national interests until 2012 it had observer status with

membership is stratified by the level of engagement with forum activities with the level of membership fees increasing as participation in meetings projects and initiatives rises in 2011 an annual membership cost 52000 for an individual member 263000 for industry partner and 527000 for strategic partner an admission fee costs 19000 per person in 2014 wef raised annual fees by 20 percent

davos switzerland bringing together chief executive officers from its 1000 member companies as well as selected politicians representatives from academia ngos religious leaders and the media in an alpine environment the winter discussions ostensibly focus around key issues of global concern such as the globalization capital markets wealth management international conflicts environmental problems and their possible solutions the participants also take part in role playing events such as the investment heat map informal winter meetings may have led to as many ideas and solutions as the official sessions at the 2018 annual meeting more than 3000 participants from nearly 110 countries participated in over 400 sessions participation included more than 340 public figures including more than 70 heads of state and government and 45 heads of international organizations 230 media representatives and almost 40 cultural leaders were represented as many as 500 journalists from online print radio and television take part with access to all sessions in the official program some of which are also webcast not all the journalists are given access to all areas however this is reserved for white badge holders davos runs an almost castelike system of badges according to bbc journalist anthony reuben a white badge means youre one of the delegates – you might be the chief executive of a company or the leader of a country although that would also get you a little holographic sticker to add to your badge or a senior journalist an orange badge means youre just a runofthemill working journalist all plenary debates from the annual meeting also are available on youtube while photographs are available on flickr some 3000 individual participants joined the 2020 annual meeting in davos countries with the most attendees include the united states 674 participants the united kingdom 270 switzerland 159 germany 137 and india 133 among the attendees were heads of state or government

business account for most of the participants backgrounds 1595 conference attendees with the remaining seats shared between government 364 ngos 246 and press 234 academia which had been the basis of the first annual conference in 1971 had been marginalised to the smallest participant group 183 attendees next to individual participants the world economic forum maintains a dense network of corporate partners that can apply for different partnership ranks within the forum for 2019 bloomberg has identified a total of 436 listed corporates that participated in the annual meeting while measuring a stock underperformance by the davos participants of around −10 versus the sp 500 during the same year drivers are among others an overrepresentation of financial companies and an underrepresentation of fastgrowing health care and information technology businesses at the conference the economist had found similar results in an earlier study showing an underperformance of davos participants against both the msci world index and the sp 500 between 2009 and 2014 in 2007 the foundation established the annual meeting of the new champions also called summer davos held annually in china alternating between dalian and tianjin bringing together 1500 participants from what the foundation calls global growth companies primarily from rapidly growing emerging countries such as china india russia mexico and brazil but also including quickly growing companies from developed countries the meeting also engages with the next generation of global leaders from fastgrowing regions and competitive cities as well as technology pioneers from around the globe the premier of china has delivered a plenary address at each annual meetingcitation needed every year regional meetings take place enabling close contact among corporate business leaders local government leaders and ngos meetings are held in africa east asia latin america and the middle east the mix of hosting countries varies from year to year but consistently china and india have hosted throughout the decade since 2000 the group of young global leaders consists of 800 people chosen by the wef organizers as being representative of contemporary leadership after five years of participation they are considered alumni the program has received controversy when schwab the founder admitted to penetrating governments with young global leaders he added that as of 2017 more than half of justin trudeaus cabinet had been members of the program since 2000 the wef has been promoting models developed by those in close collaboration with the schwab foundation for social entrepreneurship highlighting social entrepreneurship as a key element to advance societies and address social problems selected social entrepreneurs are invited to participate in the foundations regional meetings and the annual meetings where they may meet chief executives and senior government officials at the annual meeting 2003 for example jeroo billimoria met with roberto blois deputy secretarygeneral of the international telecommunication union an encounter that produced a key partnership for her organization child helpline international the foundation also acts as a think tank publishing a wide range of reports in particular strategic insight teams focus on producing reports of relevance in the fields of competitiveness global risks and scenario thinking the competitiveness team produces a range of annual economic reports first published in brackets the global competitiveness report 1979 measured competitiveness of countries and economies the global information technology report 2001 assessed their competitiveness based on their it readiness the global gender gap report examined critical areas of inequality between men and women the global risks report 2006 assessed key global risks the global travel and tourism report 2007 measured travel and tourism competitiveness the financial development report 2008 aimed to provide a comprehensive means for countries to establish benchmarks for various aspects of their financial systems and establish priorities for improvement and the global enabling trade report 2008 presented a crosscountry analysis of the large number of measures facilitating trade among nations the risk response network produces a yearly report assessing risks which are deemed to be within the scope of these teams have crossindustry relevance are uncertain have the potential to cause upwards of us10\\xa0billion in economic damage have the potential to cause major human suffering and which require a multistakeholder approach for mitigation in 2020 the forum published a report entitled nature risk rising why the crisis engulfing nature matters for business and the economy in this report the forum estimated that approximately half of global gdp is highly or moderately dependent on nature the same as ipbess 2019 assessment report the report also found that 1 dollar spent on nature restoration yields 9 dollars in economic benefits the global health initiative was launched by kofi annan at the annual meeting in 2002 the ghis mission was to engage businesses in publicprivate partnerships to tackle hivaids tuberculosis malaria and health systemscitation needed the global education initiative gei launched during the annual meeting in 2003 brought together international it companies and governments in jordan egypt and india that has resulted in new personal computer hardware being available in their classrooms and more local teachers trained in elearning the gei model which is scalable and sustainable now is being used as an educational blueprint in other countries including rwanda on 19 january 2017 the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi a global initiative to fight epidemics was launched at wef in davos the internationally funded initiative aims at securing vaccine supplies for global emergencies and pandemics and to research new vaccines for tropical diseases that are now more menacing the project is funded by private and governmental donors with an initial investment of us460m from the governments of germany japan and norway plus the bill  melinda gates foundation and the wellcome trust between 21 and 24 january 2020 at the early stages of the covid19 outbreak cepi met with leaders from moderna to establish plans for a covid19 vaccine at the davos gathering with a total global case number of 274 and total loss of life the virus at 16 the who declared a global health emergency 6 days later the

rajasthan and the nepad business foundation to develop publicprivate partnerships on water management in south africa and india in an effort to combat corruption the partnering against corruption initiative paci was launched by ceos from the engineering and construction energy and metals and mining industries at the annual meeting in davos during january 2004 paci is a platform for peer exchange on practical experience and dilemma situations approximately 140 companies have joined the initiative in the beginning of the 21st century the forum began to increasingly deal with environmental issues in the davos manifesto 2020 it is said that a company among other the environmental initiative covers climate change and water issues under the gleneagles dialogue on climate change the uk government asked the world economic forum at the g8 summit in gleneagles in 2005 to facilitate a dialogue with the business community to develop recommendations for reducing greenhouse

15 of the global carbon budget and will pass by its weight fishes in the worlds oceans one of the methods is to achieve circular economy the theme of the 2020 world economic forum annual meeting was stakeholders for a cohesive and sustainable world climate change and sustainability were central themes of discussion many argued that gdp is failed to represent correctly the wellbeing and that fossil fuel subsidies should be stopped many of the participants said that a better capitalism is needed al gore summarized the ideas in the conference as the version of capitalism we have today in our world must be reformed in this meeting the world economic forum at the 2021 annual meeting unfccc launched the un racetozero emissions breakthroughs the aim of the campaign is to transform 20 sectors of the economy in order to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions at least 20 of each sector should take specific measures and 10 sectors should be transformed before cop\\xa026 in glasgow according to the organizers 20 is a tipping point after which the whole sector begins to irreversibly change in april 2020 the forum published an article that postulates that the covid19 pandemic is linked to the destruction of nature the number of emerging diseases is rising and this rise is linked to deforestation and species loss in the article there are multiple examples of the degradation of ecological systems caused by humans it is also says that half of the global gdp is moderately or largely dependent on nature the article concludes that the recovery from the pandemic should be linked to nature recovery the forum proposed a plan for a green recovery the plan includes advancing circular economy among the mentioned methods there is green building sustainable transport organic farming urban open space renewable energy and electric vehicles the network of global future councils meets annually in the united arab emirates and virtually several times a year the second wef annual

the global recession caused by the covid19 pandemic lockdowns the great reset was to be the theme of wefs annual meeting in august 2021 according to forum founder schwab the intention of the project is to reconsider the meaning of capitalism and capital while not abandoning capitalism he proposes to change and possibly move on from some aspects of it including neoliberalism and freemarket fundamentalism the role of corporations taxation and more should be reconsidered international cooperation and trade should be defended and the fourth industrial revolution also the forum defines the system that it wants to create as stakeholder capitalism the forum supports trade unions during the late 1990s the wef as well as the g7 world bank world trade organization and international monetary fund came under heavy criticism by antiglobalization activists who claimed that capitalism and globalization were increasing poverty and destroying the environment in 2000 about 10000 demonstrators disrupted a regional wef meeting in melbourne by obstructing the path of 200 delegates small demonstrations are held in davos on most but not all years organised by the local green party see antiwef protests in switzerland january 2003 to protest against what have been called the meetings of fat cats in the snow a tongueincheek term used by rock singer bono after 2014 the physical protest movement against the world economic forum largely died down and swiss police noted a significant decline in attending protesters 20 at most during the meeting in 2016 while protesters are still more numerous in large swiss cities the protest movement itself has undergone significant change around 150 tibetans and uighurs protested in geneva and 400 tibetans in bern against the visit of chinas paramount leader xi jinping for the 2017 meeting with subsequent confrontations and arrests a number of ngos have used the world economic forum to highlight growing inequalities and wealth gaps which they consider not to be addressed extensively enough or even to be fortified through institutions like the wef winnie byanyima the executive director of the antipoverty confederation oxfam international cochaired the 2015 meeting where she presented a critical report of global wealth distribution based on statistical research by the credit suisse research institute in this study the richest 1 of people in the world own 48 of the worlds wealth at the 2019 meeting she presented another report claiming that the gap between rich and poor has only increased the report public good or private wealth stated that 2200 billionaires worldwide saw their wealth grow by 12 while the poorest half saw its wealth fall by 11 oxfam calls for a global tax overhaul to increase and harmonise global tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals youll own nothing and be happy is a phrase adapted from an essay written by ida auken in 2016 for the wef pondering a future in which urban residents would rely on shared services for many expensive items such as appliances and vehicles shortly after its publication a commentator for european digital rights criticized aukens vision of centralized property ownership as a benevolent dictatorship  during the covid19 pandemic the phrase went viral eliciting strongly negative reactions from mostly conservative but also some leftwing and unaffiliated commentators responding to viral social media posts based on the phrase the wef denied that it had a goal related to limiting ownership of private property rutger bregman a dutch historian invited to a 2018 wef panel on inequality went viral when he suggested that the best way for the attendees to attack inequality was to stop avoiding taxes bregman described his motivation saying it feels like i’m at a firefighters’ conference and no one’s allowed to speak about water the formation of a detached elite which is often colabelled through the neologism davos man refers to a global group whose members view themselves as completely international the term refers to people who have little need for national loyalty view national boundaries as obstacles and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elites global operations according to political scientist samuel p huntington who is credited with inventing the neologism in his 2004 article dead souls the denationalization of the american elite huntington argues that this international perspective is a minority elitist position not shared by the nationalist majority of the people the transnational institute describes the world economic forums main purpose as being to function as a socializing institution for the emerging global elite globalizations mafiocracy of bankers industrialists oligarchs technocrats and politicians they promote common ideas and serve common interests their own in 2019 the manager magazin journalist henrik müller argued that the davos man had already decayed into different groups and camps he sees three central drivers for this development critics argue that the wef despite having reserves of several hundred million swiss francs and paying its executives salaries of around 1 million swiss francs per year would not pay any federal tax and moreover allocate a part of its costs to the public following massive criticism from politicians and the swiss civil society the swiss federal government decided in february 2021 to reduce its annual contributions to the wef as of 2018 the police and military expenditures carried by the federal government stood at 39 million swiss francs the aargauer zeitung argued in january 2020 that the additional cost borne by the kanton graubünden stand at chf 9 million per year the swiss green party summarised their criticism within the swiss national council that the holding of the world economic forum has cost swiss taxpayers hundreds of millions of swiss francs over the past decades in their view it was however questionable to what extent the swiss population or global community benefit from these expenditures women have been broadly underrepresented at the wef according to some critics the female participation rate at the wef increased from 9 to 15 between 2001 and 2005 in 2016 18 of the wef attendees were female this number increased to 21 in 2017 and 24 in 2020 several women have since shared their personal impressions of the davos meetings in media articles highlighting that issues were more profound than a quota at davos for female leaders or a session on diversity and inclusion the world economic forum has in this context filed legal complaints against at least three investigative articles by reporters katie gibbons and billy kenber that were published by the british newspaper the times in march 2020 according to the european parliaments think tank critics see the wef as an instrument for political and business leaders to take decisions without having to account to their electorate or shareholders since 2009 the wef has been working on a project called the global redesign initiative gri which proposes a transition away from intergovernmental decisionmaking towards a system of multistakeholder governance according to the transnational institute tni the forum is hence planning to replace a recognised democratic model with a model where a selfselected group of stakeholders make decisions on behalf of the people some critics have seen the wefs attention to goals like environmental protection and social entrepreneurship as mere window dressing to disguise its true plutocratic nature and goals in a guardian opinion piece cas mudde said that such plutocrats should not be the group to have control over the political agendas and decide which issues to focus on and how to support them a writer in the german magazine cicero saw the situation as academic cultural media and economic elites grasping for social power while disregarding political decision processes a materially wellendowed milieu would in this context try to cement its dominance of opinion and sedate ordinary people with maternalisticpaternalistic social benefits so that they are not disturbed by the common people when they steer the french les echos furthermore concludes that davos represents the exact values people rejected at the ballot box in 2017 the former frankfurter allgemeine zeitung journalist jürgen dunsch criticized that financial reports of the wef were not very transparent since neither income nor expenditures were broken down in addition he outlined that the foundation capital was not quantified while the apparently not insignificant profits would be reinvested recent annual reports published by the wef include a more detailed breakdown of its financials and indicate revenues of chf 349 million for the year 2019 with reserves of chf 310 million and a foundation capital of chf 34 million there are no further details provided to what asset classes or individual names the wef allocates its financial assets of chf 261 million the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung criticised in this context that the wef had turned into a money printing machine which is run like a family business and forms a comfortable way to make a living for its key personnel the foundations founder klaus schwab draws a salary of around one million swiss francs per year in a request to the swiss national council the swiss green party criticised that invitations to the annual meeting and programmes of the world economic forum are issued according to unclear criteria they highlight that despots such as the son of the former libyan dictator saif alislam algaddafi had been invited to the wef and even awarded membership in the club of young global leaders even after the beginning of the arab spring in december 2010 and related violent uprisings against despot regimes the wef continued to invite gaddafi to its annual meeting critics emphasise that the annual meeting of the world economic forum is counterproductive when combating pressing problems of humanity such as the climate crisis even in 2020 participants travelled to the wef annual meeting in davos on around 1300 private jets while the total emissions burden from transport and accommodation were enormous in their view the world economic forums global redesign report suggests to create publicprivate united nations un in which selected agencies operate and steer global agendas under shared governance systems it says that a globalised world is probably best managed by a coalition of multinational corporations governments and civil society organizations csos which it expresses through initiatives like the great reset and the global redesign in september 2019 more than 400 civil society organizations and 40 international networks heavily criticised a partnership agreement between wef and the united nations and called on the un secretarygeneral to end it they see such an agreement as a disturbing corporate capture of the un which moved the world dangerously towards a privatised global governance the dutch transnational institute think tank summarises that we are increasingly entering a world where gatherings such as davos are a silent global coup détat to capture governance in 2019 the swiss newspaper woz received a refusal of its accreditation request for the annual meeting with the editors and subsequently accused the world economic forum of favoring specific media outlets the newspaper highlighted that the wef stated in its refusal message that it the forum prefers media outlets it works with throughout the year woz deputy head yves wegelin called this a strange idea of journalism because in journalism you dont necessarily have to work with large corporations but rather critique them in addition to economic policy the wefs agenda is in recent years increasingly focusing on positively connoted activist topics such as environmental protection and social entrepreneurship which critics see as a strategy to disguise the organisations true plutocratic goals in a december 2020 article by the intercept author naomi klein described that the wefs initiatives like the great reset were simply a coronavirusthemed rebranding of things that the wef was already doing and that it was an attempt by the rich to make themselves look good in her opinion the great reset is merely the latest edition of this gilded tradition barely distinguishable from earlier davos big ideas similarly in his review of covid19 the great reset ethicist steven umbrello makes parallel critiques of the agenda he says that the wef whitewashes a seemingly optimistic future postgreat reset with buzz words like equity and sustainability while it functionally jeopardizes those goals a study published in the journal of consumer research investigated the sociological impact of the wef it concluded that the wef do not solve issues such as poverty global warming chronic illness or debt the forum has according to the study simply shifted the burden for the solution of these problems from governments and business to responsible consumers subjects the green consumer the healthconscious consumer and the financially literate consumer in december 2021 the catholic cardinal and former prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith cdf gerhard ludwig müller criticised in a controversial interview that people like wef founder schwab were sitting on the throne of their wealth and were not touched by the everyday difficulties and sufferings people face eg due to the covid19 pandemic on the contrary such elites would see crises as an opportunity to push through their agendas he particularly criticised the control such people would exercise on people and their embracement of areas such as transhumanism the german central council of jews condemned this criticism which is also linked to jewish financial investors as antisemitic on the other hand the wef has been criticized as hypocritical towards palestinian human rights when it rejected a petition from its own constituents to condemn israels aggression against palestinians wef cited the need to remain impartial on the issue however claims of hypocrisy came after it voluntarily condemned russias aggression against ukraine months later in june 2021 wef founder klaus schwab sharply criticised what he characterized as the profiteering complacency and lack of commitment by the municipality of davos in relation to the annual meeting he mentioned that the preparation of the covidrelated meeting in singapore in 20212022 had created an alternative to its swiss host and sees the chance that the annual meeting will stay in davos between 40 and 70 per cent as there are many other international conferences nicknamed with davos such as the davos of the desert event organised by saudi arabias future investment initiative institute the world economic forum objected to the use of davos in such contexts for any event not organised by them this particular statement was issued on 22 october 2018 a day before the opening of 2018 future investment initiative nicknamed davos in the desert organised by the public investment fund of saudi arabia since the annual meeting in january 2003 in davos an open forum davos which was coorganized by the federation of swiss protestant churches is held concurrently with the davos forum opening up the debate about globalization to the general public the open forum has been held in the local high school every year featuring top politicians and business leaders it is open to all members of the public free of charge the public eye awards have been held every year since 2000 it is a counterevent to the annual meeting of the world economic forum wef in davos public eye awards is a public competition of the worst corporations in the world in 2011 more than 50000 people voted for companies that acted irresponsibly at a ceremony at a davos hotel the winners in 2011 were named as indonesian palm oil diesel maker neste oil in finland and mining company anglogold ashanti in south africa according to schweiz aktuell broadcast on 16 january 2015 a public presence during the wef 2015 may not be guaranteed because the massively increased security in davos the public eye award will be awarded for the last time in davos public eyes says goodbye to davos confirmed by rolf marugg now landrats politician by not directly engaged politicians and by the police responsible an

khyber pakhtunkhwa and some areas of jammu and kashmir india it registered a moment magnitude of 76 and had a maximum mercalli intensity of xi extreme the earthquake was also felt in afghanistan tajikistan india and the xinjiang region the severity of the damage caused by the earthquake is attributed to severe upthrust over 86000 people died a similar number were injured and millions were displaced it is considered the deadliest earthquake in south asia surpassing the 1935 quetta earthquake kashmir lies in the area of collision of the eurasian and indian tectonic plates the geological activity born out of this collision also responsible for the birth of the himalayan mountain range is the cause of unstable seismicity in the region the united states geological survey usgs measured its magnitude as a minimum of 76 on the moment magnitude scale with its epicentre about 19\\xa0km 12\\xa0mi northeast of muzaffarabad azad jammu and kashmir a region under the state of pakistan and

of muzaffarabad and balakot it was also assigned xi on the environmental seismic intensity scale field surveys of heavy damage to buildings and other structures in balakot determined that the modified mercalli intensity exceeded x at muzaffarabad the intensity peaked at viii–ix severe–violent intensity vii–viii very strong–severe was determined in the areas south of muzaffarabad the maximum intensity in bharat was viii destructive on the medvedev–sponheuer–karnik scale msk and was felt at uri msk vii was felt in kupwara and baramulla in srinagar the earthquake was felt with an msk intensity of v at areas where the seismic intensity was lower collapses were documented the earthquake was felt throughout central asia and  as far away as dushanbe tajikistan minor shaking was felt in almaty kazakhstan there were many secondary earthquakes in the region mainly to the northwest of the original epicentre a series of strong aftershocks occurred near muzaffarabad as of 27 october 2005 there had been more than 978 aftershocks with a magnitude of 40 and above that continued to occur daily since then measurements from satellites have shown that mountain parts directly above the epicenter have risen by a few meters giving ample proof that the himalayas are still being formed and growing and that this earthquake was a consequence of that by the end of 2005 a total of 1778 aftershocks were recorded  most of the devastation hit azad jammu and kashmir and other parts of northern pakistan in ajk the three main districts were badly affected and muzaffarabad the state capital of azad jammu and kashmir was hardest hit in terms of casualties and destruction hospitals schools and rescue services including police and armed forces were paralysed there was virtually no

more than 500000 families in addition approximately 250000 farm animals died due to the collapse of stone barns and more than 500000 large animals required immediate shelter from the harsh wintercitation needed about 200 soldiers were also killed in the epicentral area as saturday is a normal school day in the region most students were at schools when the earthquake struck many were buried under collapsed school buildings in mansehra district khyber pakhtunkhwa one collapsing school killed 350 students while another school in the same district killed an additional fifty students many people were also trapped in their homes and because it was the month of ramadan most people were taking a nap after their predawn meal and did not have time to escape reports indicate that entire towns and villages were completely wiped out in northern pakistan with other surrounding areas also suffering severe damagecitation needed according to pakistans interior minister aftab ahmad sherpao prime minister shaukat aziz made the appeal to survivors on 26 october to come down to valleys and cities for relief because bad weather mountainous terrain landslides and blocked roads are making it difficult for relief workers to reach each house and the winter snows are imminent at least 1350 people were killed and 6266 injured in jammu and kashmir india in uri there were over 150 deaths the

helicopters stationed in neighbouring afghanistan quickly flew aid into the devastated region along with five ch47 chinook helicopters from the royal air force that were deployed from the united kingdom five crossing points were opened on the line of control loc between india and pakistan to facilitate the flow of humanitarian and medical aid to the affected region and aid teams from different parts of pakistan and around the world came to the region to assist in relief efforts the guardian is a british daily newspaper it was founded in 1821 as the manchester guardian before it changed its name in 1959 along with its sister papers the observer and the guardian weekly the guardian is part of the guardian media group owned by the scott trust limited the trust was created in 1936 to secure the financial and editorial independence of the guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of the guardian free from commercial or political interference the trust was converted into a limited company in 2008 with a constitution written so as to maintain for the guardian the same protections as were built into the structure of the scott trust by its creators profits are reinvested in its journalism rather than distributed to owners or shareholders it is considered a newspaper of record in the uk the editorinchief katharine viner succeeded alan rusbridger in 2015 since 2018 the papers main newsprint sections have been published in tabloid format as of july\\xa02021update its print edition had a daily circulation of 105134 the newspaper has an online edition theguardiancom as well as three international websites guardian australia founded in 2013 guardian new zealand founded in 2019 and guardian us founded in 2011 the papers readership is generally on the mainstream left of british political opinion and the term guardian reader is used to imply a stereotype of liberal leftwing or politically correct views frequent typographical errors during the age of manual typesetting led private eye magazine to dub the paper the grauniad in the 1970s a nickname still occasionally used by the editors for selfmockery in an ipsos mori research poll in september 2018 designed to interrogate the publics trust of specific titles online the guardian scored highest for digitalcontent news with 84 of readers agreeing that they trust what they see in it a december 2018 report of a poll by the publishers audience measurement company stated that the papers print edition was found to be the most trusted in the uk in the period from october 2017 to september 2018 it was also reported to be the mostread of the uks quality newsbrands including digital editions other quality brands included the times the daily telegraph the independent and the i while the guardians print circulation is in decline the report indicated that news from the guardian including that reported online reaches more than 23 million uk adults each month chief among the notable scoops obtained by the paper was the 2011 news international phonehacking scandal—and in particular the hacking of the murdered english teenager milly dowlers phone the investigation led to the closure of the news of the world the uks bestselling sunday newspaper and one of the highestcirculation newspapers in history in june 2013 the guardian broke news of the secret collection by the obama administration of verizon telephone records and subsequently revealed the existence of the surveillance program prism after knowledge of it was leaked to the paper by the whistleblower and former national security agency contractor edward snowden in 2016 the guardian led an investigation into the panama papers exposing then–prime minister david camerons links to offshore bank accounts it has been named newspaper of the year four times at the annual british press awards most recently in 2014 for its reporting on government surveillance the manchester guardian was founded in manchester in 1821 by cotton merchant john edward taylor with backing from the little circle a group of nonconformist businessmen they launched the paper on 5 may 1821 by chance the very day of napoleons death after the police closure of the more radical manchester observer a paper that had championed the cause of the peterloo massacre protesters taylor had been hostile to the radical reformers writing they have appealed not to the reason but the passions and the suffering of their abused and credulous fellowcountrymen from whose illrequited industry they extort for themselves the means of a plentiful and comfortable existence they do not toil neither do they spin but they live better than those that do when the government closed down the manchester observer the millowners champions had the upper hand the influential journalist jeremiah garnett joined taylor during the establishment of the paper and all of the little circle wrote articles for the new paper the prospectus announcing the new publication proclaimed that it would zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious liberty  warmly advocate the cause of reform  endeavour to assist in the diffusion of just principles of political economy and  support without reference to the party from which they emanate all serviceable measures in 1825 the paper merged with the british volunteer and was known as the manchester guardian and british volunteer until 1828 the workingclass manchester and salford advertiser called the manchester guardian the foul prostitute and dirty parasite of the worst portion of the millowners the manchester guardian was generally hostile to labours claims of the 1832 ten hours bill the paper doubted whether in view of the foreign competition the passing of a law positively enacting a gradual destruction of the cotton manufacture in this kingdom would be a much less rational procedure the manchester guardian dismissed strikes as the work of outside agitators stating that if an accommodation can be effected the occupation of the agents of the union is gone they live on strife   in march 2023 an academic review commissioned by the scott trust determined that john edward taylor and nine of his eleven backers had links to the atlantic slave trade through their interests in manchesters textile industry the newspaper opposed slavery and supported free trade an 1823 leading article on the continuing cruelty and injustice to slaves in the west indies long after the abolition of the slave trade with the slave trade act 1807 wanted fairness to the interests and claims both of the planters and of their oppressed slaves it welcomed the slavery abolition act 1833 and accepted the increased compensation to the planters as the guilt of slavery attaches far more to the nation rather than individuals success of the act would encourage emancipation in other slaveowning nations to avoid imminent risk of a violent and bloody termination however the newspaper argued against restricting trade with countries which had not yet abolished slavery complex tensions developed in the united states when the abolitionist george thompson toured the newspaper said that slavery is a monstrous evil but civil war is not a less one and we would not seek the abolition even of the former through the imminent hazard of the latter it suggested that the united states should compensate slaveowners for freeing slaves and called on president franklin pierce to resolve the 1856 civil war the sacking of lawrence due to proslavery laws imposed by congress in 1860 the observer quoted a report that the newly elected president abraham lincoln was opposed to abolition of slavery on 13 may 1861 shortly after the start of the american civil war the manchester guardian portrayed the northern states as primarily imposing a burdensome trade monopoly on the confederate states arguing that if the south was freed to have direct trade with europe the day would not be distant when slavery itself would cease therefore the newspaper asked why should the south be prevented from freeing itself from slavery this hopeful view was also held by the liberal leader william ewart gladstone there was division in britain over the civil war even within political parties the manchester guardian had also been conflicted it had supported other independence movements and felt it should also support the rights of the confederacy to selfdetermination it criticised lincolns emancipation proclamation for not freeing all american slaves on 10 october 1862 it wrote it is impossible to cast any reflections upon a man so evidently sincere and wellintentioned as mr lincoln but it is also impossible not to feel that it was an evil day both for america and the world when he was chosen president of the united states by then the union blockade was causing suffering in british towns some including liverpool supported the confederacy as did current opinion in all classes in london on 31 december 1862 cotton workers held a meeting at the free trade hall in manchester which resolved its detestation of negro slavery in america and of the attempt of the rebellious southern slaveholders to organise on the great american continent a nation having slavery as its basis there was a comment that an effort had been made in a leading article of the manchester guardian to deter the working men from assembling together for such a purpose the newspaper reported all this and published their letter to president lincoln while complaining that the chief occupation if not the chief object of the meeting seems to have been to abuse the manchester guardian lincoln replied to the letter thanking the workers for their sublime christian heroism and american ships delivered relief supplies to britain the newspaper reported the shock to the community of the assassination of abraham lincoln in 1865 concluding that the parting of his family with the dying president is too sad for description but in what from todays perspective looks an illjudged editorial wrote that of his rule we can never speak except as a series of acts abhorrent to every true notion of constitutional right and human liberty adding it is doubtless to be regretted that he had not the opportunity of vindicating his good intentions according to martin kettle writing for the guardian in february 2011 the guardian had always hated slavery but it doubted the union hated slavery to the same degree it argued that the union had always tacitly condoned slavery by shielding the southern slave states from the condemnation they deserved it was critical of lincolns emancipation proclamation for stopping short of a full repudiation of slavery throughout the us and it chastised the president for being so willing to negotiate with the south with slavery one of the issues still on the table c p scott made the newspaper nationally recognised he was editor for 57 years from 1872 and became its owner when he bought the paper from the estate of taylors son in 1907 under scott the papers moderate editorial line became more radical supporting william gladstone when the liberals split in 1886 and opposing the second boer war against popular opinion scott supported the movement for womens suffrage but was critical of any tactics by the suffragettes that involved direct action the really ludicrous position is that mr lloyd george is fighting to enfranchise seven million women and the militants are smashing unoffending peoples windows and breaking up benevolent societies meetings in a desperate effort to prevent him scott thought the suffragettes courage and devotion was worthy of a better cause and saner leadership it has been argued that scotts criticism reflected a widespread disdain at the time for those women who transgressed the gender expectations of edwardian society scott commissioned j m synge and his friend jack yeats to produce articles and drawings documenting the social conditions of the west of ireland these pieces were published in 1911 in the collection travels in wicklow west kerry and connemara scotts friendship with chaim weizmann played a role in the balfour declaration in 1948 the manchester guardian was a supporter of the new state of israelcitation needed ownership of the paper passed in june 1936 to the scott trust named after the last owner john russell scott who was the first chairman of the trust this move ensured the papers independenceadditional citations needed from 1930 to 1967 a special archival copy of all the daily newspapers was preserved in 700 zinc cases these were found in 1988 whilst the newspapers archives were deposited at the university of manchesters john rylands university library on the oxford road campus the first case was opened and found to contain the newspapers issued in august 1930 in pristine condition the zinc cases had been made each month by the newspapers plumber and stored for posterity the other 699 cases were not opened and were all returned to storage at the guardians garage owing to shortage of space at the library traditionally affiliated with the centrist to centreleft liberal party and with a northern nonconformist circulation base the paper earned a national reputation and the respect of the left during the spanish civil war 1936–1939 george orwell wrote in homage to catalonia 1938 of our larger papers the manchester guardian is the only one that leaves me with an increased respect for its honesty with the proliberal news chronicle the laboursupporting daily herald the communist partys daily worker and several sunday and weekly papers it supported the republican government against general francisco francos insurgent nationalists the papers then editor a p wadsworth so loathed labours leftwing champion aneurin bevan who had made a reference to getting rid of tory vermin in a speech and the hategospellers of his entourage that it encouraged readers to vote conservative in the 1951 general election and remove clement attlees postwar labour government the newspaper opposed the creation of the national health service as it feared the state provision of healthcare would eliminate selective elimination and lead to an increase of congenitally deformed and feckless people the manchester guardian strongly opposed military intervention during the 1956 suez crisis the anglofrench ultimatum to egypt is an act of folly without justification in any terms but brief expediency it pours petrol on a growing fire there is no knowing what kind of explosion will follow on 24 august 1959 the manchester guardian changed its name to the guardian this change reflected the growing prominence of national and international affairs in the newspaper in september 1961 the guardian which had previously only been published in manchester began to be printed in london\\nnesta roberts was appointed as the newspapers first news editor there becoming the first woman to hold such a position on a british national newspaper\\n when 13 civil rights demonstrators in northern ireland were killed by the parachute regiment on 30 january 1972 known as bloody sunday the guardian wrote that neither side can escape condemnation of the protesters they wrote the organizers of the demonstration miss bernadette devlin among them deliberately challenged the ban on marches they knew that stone throwing and sniping could not be prevented and that the ira might use the crowd as a shield of the british soldiers present they wrote there seems little doubt that random shots were fired into the crowd that aim was taken at individuals who were neither bombers nor weapons carriers and that excessive force was used many irish people believed that the widgery tribunals ruling on the killings was a whitewash a view that was later supported with the publication of the bloody sunday inquiry in 2010 but in 1972 the guardian wrote that widgerys report is not onesided 20 april 1972 at the time the paper also supported internment without trial in northern ireland internment without trial is hateful repressive and undemocratic in the existing irish situation most regrettably it is also inevitable to remove the ringleaders in the hope that the atmosphere might calm down is a step to which there is no obvious alternative before then in 1969 the guardian had called for british troops to be sent to the region stating that their deployment could present a more disinterested face of law and order but only on condition that britain takes charge in 1983 the paper was at the centre of a controversy surrounding documents regarding the stationing of cruise missiles in britain that were leaked to the guardian by civil servant sarah tisdall the paper eventually complied with a court order to hand over the documents to the authorities which resulted in a sixmonth prison sentence for tisdall though she served only four i still blame myself said peter preston who was the editor of the guardian at the time but he went on to argue that the paper had no choice because it believed in the rule of law in a 2019 article discussing julian assange and the protection of sources by journalists john pilger criticised the editor of the guardian for betraying tisdall by choosing not to go to prison on a fundamental principle of protecting a source in 1994 kgb defector oleg gordievsky identified guardian literary editor richard gott as an agent of influence while gott denied that he received cash he admitted he had had lunch at the soviet embassy and had taken benefits from the kgb on overseas visits gott resigned from his post gordievsky commented on the newspaper the kgb loved the guardian it was deemed highly susceptible to penetration in 1995 both the granada television programme world in action and the guardian were sued for libel by the then cabinet minister jonathan aitken for their allegation that harrods owner mohamed al fayed had paid for aitken and his wife to stay at the hôtel ritz in paris which would have amounted to accepting a bribe on aitkens part aitken publicly stated that he would fight with the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of british fair play the court case proceeded and in 1997 the guardian produced evidence that aitkens claim of his wife paying for the hotel stay was untrue in 1999 aitken was jailed for perjury and perverting the course of justice in may 1998 a series of guardian investigations exposed the wholesale fabrication of a muchgarlanded itv documentary the connection produced by carlton television the documentary purported to film an undiscovered route by which heroin was smuggled into the united kingdom from colombia an internal inquiry at carlton found that the guardians allegations were in large part correct and the then industry regulator the itc punished carlton with a record £2 million fine for multiple breaches of the uks broadcasting codes the scandal led to an impassioned debate about the accuracy of documentary production later in june 1998 the guardian revealed further fabrications in another carlton documentary from the same director the paper supported natos military intervention in the kosovo war in 1998–1999 the guardian stated that the only honourable course for europe and america is to use military force mary kaldors piece was headlined bombs away but to save civilians we must get in some soldiers too in the early 2000s the guardian challenged the act of settlement 1701 and the treason felony act 1848 in october 2004 the guardian published a humorous column by charlie brooker in its entertainment guide the final sentence of which was viewed by some as a call for violence against us president george w bush after a controversy brooker and the paper issued an apology saying the closing comments were intended as an ironic joke not as a call to action following the 7 july 2005 london bombings the guardian published an article on its comment pages by dilpazier aslam a 27yearold british muslim and journalism trainee from yorkshire aslam was a member of hizb uttahrir an islamist group and had published a number of articles on their website according to the newspaper it did not know that aslam was a member of hizb uttahrir when he applied to become a trainee though several staff members were informed of this once he started at the paper the home office said that the groups ultimate aim is the establishment of an islamic state caliphate according to hizb uttahrir via nonviolent means the guardian asked aslam to resign his membership of the group and when he did not do so terminated his employment in early 2009 the guardian started a tax investigation into a number of major uk companies including publishing a database of the tax paid by the ftse 100 companies internal documents relating to barclays banks tax avoidance were removed from the guardian website after barclays obtained a gagging order the newspaper played a pivotal role in exposing the depth of the news of the world phone hacking affair the economists intelligent life magazine opined that as watergate is to the washington post and thalidomide to the sunday times so phonehacking will surely be to the guardian a defining moment in its history in recent decades the guardian has been accused of biased criticism of israeli government policy and of bias against the palestinians in december 2003 columnist julie burchill cited striking bias against the state of israel as one of the reasons she left the paper for the times responding to these accusations a guardian editorial in 2002 condemned antisemitism and defended the papers right to criticise the policies and actions of the israeli government arguing that those who view such criticism as inherently antijewish are mistaken harriet sherwood then the guardians foreign editor later its jerusalem correspondent has also denied that the guardian has an antiisrael bias saying that the paper aims to cover all viewpoints in the israeli–palestinian conflict on 6 november 2011 chris elliott the guardians readers editor wrote that guardian reporters writers and editors must be more vigilant about the language they use when writing about jews or israel citing recent cases where the guardian received complaints regarding language chosen to describe jews or israel elliott noted that over nine months he upheld complaints regarding language in certain articles that were seen as antisemitic revising the language and footnoting this change the guardians style guide section referred to tel aviv as the capital of israel in 2012 the guardian later clarified in 1980 the israeli knesset enacted a law designating the city of jerusalem including east jerusalem as the countrys capital in response the un security council issued resolution 478 censuring the change in character and status of the holy city of jerusalem and calling on all member states with diplomatic missions in the city to withdraw the un has reaffirmed this position on several occasions and almost every country now has its embassy in tel aviv while it was therefore right to issue a correction to make clear israels designation of jerusalem as its capital is not recognised by the international community we accept that it is wrong to state that tel aviv – the countrys financial and diplomatic centre – is the capital the style guide has been amended accordingly on 11 august 2014 the print edition of the guardian published a proisraeli advocacy advert during the 2014 israel–gaza conflict featuring elie wiesel headed by the words jews rejected child sacrifice 3500 years ago now its hamas turn the times had decided against running the ad although it had already appeared in major american newspapers one week later chris elliott expressed the opinion that the newspaper should have rejected the language used in the advert and should have negotiated with the advertiser on this matter in august 2004 for the us presidential election the daily g2 supplement launched an experimental letterwriting campaign in clark county ohio an averagesized county in a swing state editor ian katz bought a voter list from the county for 25 and asked readers to write to people listed as undecided in the election giving them an impression of the international view and the importance of voting against president george w bushcircular reference katz admitted later that he did not believe democrats who warned that the campaign would benefit bush and not opponent john kerry the newspaper scrapped operation clark county on 21 october 2004 after first publishing a column of responses—nearly all of them outraged—to the campaign under the headline dear limey assholes some commentators suggested that the publics dislike of the campaign contributed to bushs victory in clark county in 2007 the paper launched guardian america an attempt to capitalise on its large online readership in the united states which at the time stood at more than 59 million the company hired former american prospect editor new york magazine columnist and new york review of books writer michael tomasky to head the project and hire a staff of american reporters and web editors the site featured news from the guardian that was relevant to an american audience coverage of us news and the middle east for example tomasky stepped down from his position as editor of guardian america in february 2009 ceding editing and planning duties to other us and london staff he retained his position as a columnist and blogger taking the title editoratlarge in october 2009 the company abandoned the guardian america homepage instead directing users to a us news index page on the main guardian website the following month the company laid off six american employees including a reporter a multimedia producer and four web editors the move came as guardian news and media opted to reconsider its us strategy amid a huge effort to cut costs across the company in subsequent years however the guardian has hired various commentators on us affairs including ana marie cox michael wolff naomi wolf glenn greenwald and george w bushs former speechwriter josh treviño treviños first blog post was an apology for a controversial tweet posted in june 2011 over the second gaza flotilla the controversy which had been revived by the appointment guardian us launched in september 2011 led by editorinchief janine gibson which replaced the previous guardian america service after a period during which katharine viner served as the us editorinchief before taking charge of guardian news and media as a whole viners former deputy lee glendinning was appointed to succeed her as head of the american operation at the beginning of june 2015 in october 2009 the guardian reported that it was forbidden to report on a parliamentary matter – a question recorded in a commons order paper to be answered by a minister later that week the newspaper noted that it was being forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented—for the first time in memory—from reporting parliament legal obstacles which cannot be identified involve proceedings which cannot be mentioned on behalf of a client who must remain secret the only fact the guardian can report is that the case involves the london solicitors carterruck the paper further claimed that this case appears to call into question privileges guaranteeing free speech established under the 1689 bill of rights the only parliamentary question mentioning carterruck in the relevant period was by paul farrelly mp in reference to legal action by barclays and trafigura the part of the question referencing carterruck relates to the latter companys september 2009 gagging order on the publication of a 2006 internal report into the 2006 côte divoire toxic waste dump scandal which involved a class action case that the company only settled in september 2009 after the guardian published some of the commodity traders internal emails the reporting injunction was lifted the next day as carterruck withdrew it before the guardian could challenge it in the high court alan rusbridger attributed the rapid backdown by carterruck to postings on twitter as did a bbc news online article in june 2013 the newspaper broke news of the secret collection of verizon telephone records held by barack obamas administration and subsequently revealed the existence of the prism surveillance program after it was leaked to the paper by former nsa contractor edward snowden the guardian said a dsmanotice had been sent to editors and journalists on 7 june after the first guardian story about the snowden documents it said the dsmanotice was being used as an attempt to censor coverage of surveillance tactics employed by intelligence agencies in the uk and us the newspaper was subsequently contacted by the british governments cabinet secretary sir jeremy heywood under instruction from prime minister david cameron and deputy prime minister nick clegg who ordered that the hard drives containing the information be destroyed the guardians offices were then visited in july by agents from the uks gchq who supervised the destruction of the hard drives containing information acquired from snowden the guardian said it had destroyed the hard drives to avoid threatened legal action by the uk government that could have stopped it from reporting on us and british government surveillance contained in the documents in june 2014 the register reported that the information the government sought to suppress by destroying the hard drives related to the location of a beyond top secret internet monitoring base in seeb oman and the close involvement of bt and cable  wireless in intercepting internet communications julian assange criticised the newspaper for not publishing the entirety of the content when it had the chance rusbridger had initially covered the snowden documents without the governments supervision but subsequently sought it and established an ongoing relationship with the defence ministry the guardian coverage of snowden later continued because the information had already been copied outside the united kingdom earning the companys us website the guardian us an american pulitzer prize for public service in 2014 rusbridger and subsequent chief editors would sit on the governments dsmanotice board in a november 2018 guardian article luke harding and dan collyns cited anonymous sources which stated that donald trumps former campaign manager paul manafort held secret meetings with wikileaks founder julian assange inside the ecuadorian embassy in london in 2013 2015 and 2016 the name of a third author fernando villavicencio was removed from the online version of the story soon after publication the title of the story was originally manafort held secret talks with assange in ecuadorian embassy a few hours after publication sources say was added to the title and the meeting became an apparent meeting one reporter characterized the story if its right it might be the biggest get this year if its wrong it might be the biggest gaffe manafort and assange both denied ever having met with the latter threatening legal action against the guardian ecuadors london consul fidel narváez who had worked at ecuadors embassy in london from 2010 to july 2018 denied that manaforts visits had happened serge halimi said harding had a personal grievance against assange and noted that manaforts name does not appear in the ecuadorian embassys visitors book and there were no pictures of manafort entering or leaving one of the most surveilled and filmed buildings on the planet the guardian was accused of being racist and misogynistic after it published a cartoon depicting home secretary priti patel as a cow with a ring in its nose in an alleged reference to her hindu faith since cows are considered sacred in hinduism journalist glenn greenwald a former contributor to the guardian has accused the guardian of falsifying the words of wikileaks founder julian assange in a report about the interview he gave to italian newspaper la repubblica in the intercept greenwald wrote this article is about how those guardians false claims—fabrications really—were spread all over the internet by journalists causing hundreds of thousands of people if not millions to consume false news the guardian later amended its article about assangeclarification needed after publishing a story on 13 january 2017 claiming that whatsapp had a backdoor that allows snooping on messages more than 70 professional cryptographers signed on to an open letter calling for the guardian to retract the article on 13 june 2017 readers editor paul chadwick released an article detailing the flawed reporting in the original january article which was amended to remove references to a backdoor in december 2022 it was reported that the guardian had suffered a significant cyberattack on its office systems thought to be ransomware staff were directed to work from home and were able to continue publishing to the website despite the loss of some internal systems the print edition also continued to be produced on the 4th of january 2023 uk staff were informed of a security breach and that the information commissioners office had been notified as required by gdpr  it was indicated that staff would continue working from home until at least january 23 the newspaper confirmed on 11 january that personal details of all uk staff had been accessed by criminals the guardian is part of the guardian media group gmg of newspapers radio stations and print media gmg components include the observer the guardian weekly and theguardiancom all were owned by the scott trust a charitable foundation existing between 1936 and 2008 which aimed to ensure the papers editorial independence in perpetuity maintaining its financial health to ensure it did not become vulnerable to takeovers by commercial media groups at the beginning of october 2008 the scott trusts assets were transferred to a new limited company the scott trust limited with the intention being that the original trust would be wound up dame liz forgan chair of the scott trust reassured staff that the purposes of the new company remained the same as under the previous arrangements the guardian is the only british national daily to conduct since 2003 an annual social ethical and environmental audit in which it examines under the scrutiny of an independent external auditor its own behaviour as a company it is also the only british national daily newspaper to employ an internal ombudsman called the readers editor to handle complaints and corrections the guardian and its parent groups participate in project syndicate and intervened in 1995 to save the mail  guardian in south africa gmg sold the majority of its shares of the mail  guardian in 2002 the guardian was consistently lossmaking until 2019 the national newspaper division of gmg which also includes the observer reported operating losses of £499 million in 2006 up from £186 million in 2005 the paper was therefore heavily dependent on crosssubsidisation from profitable companies within the group the continual losses made by the national newspaper division of the guardian media group caused it to dispose of its regional media division by selling titles to competitor trinity mirror in march 2010 this included the flagship manchester evening news and severed the historic link between that paper and the guardian the sale was in order to safeguard the future of the guardian newspaper as is the intended purpose of the scott trust in june 2011 guardian news and media revealed increased annual losses of £33 million and announced that it was looking to focus on its online edition for news coverage leaving the print edition to contain more comments and features it was also speculated that the guardian might become the first british national daily paper to be fully online for the three years up to june 2012 the paper lost £100000 a day which prompted intelligent life to question whether the guardian could survive between 2007 and 2014 the guardian media group sold all their side businesses of regional papers and online portals for classifieds and consolidated into the guardian as sole product the sales let them acquire a capital stock of £8383 million as of july 2014 supposed to guarantee the independence of the guardian in perpetuity in the first year the paper made more losses than predicted and in january 2016 the publishers announced that the guardian will cut 20 per cent of staff and costs within the next three years the newspaper is rare in calling for direct contributions to deliver the independent journalism the world needs the guardian media groups 2018 annual report year ending 1 april 2018 indicated some significant changes occurring its digital online editions accounted for over 50 of group revenues by that time the loss from news and media operations was £186 million 52 lower than during the prior year 2017 £389 million the group had cut costs by £191 million partly by switching its print edition to the tabloid format the guardian media groups owner the scott trust endowment fund reported that its value at the time was £101 billion 2017 £103 billion in the following financial report for the year 2018–2019 the group reported a profit ebitda of £08 million before exceptional items thus breaking even in 2019 to be sustainable the annual subsidy must fall within the £25\\xa0million of interest returned on the investments from the scott trust endowment fund in 2014 the guardian launched a membership scheme the scheme aims to reduce the financial losses incurred by the guardian without introducing a paywall thus maintaining open access to the website website readers can pay a monthly subscription with three tiers available as of 2018 this approach was considered successful having brought more than 1 million subscriptions or donations with the paper hoping to break even by april 2019 in 2016 the company established a usbased philanthropic arm to raise money from individuals and organizations including think tanks and corporate foundations the grants are focused by the donors on particular issues by the following year the organization had raised 1\\xa0million from the likes of pierre omidyars humanity united the skoll foundation and the conrad n hilton foundation to finance reporting on topics including modernday slavery and climate change the guardian has stated that it has secured 6\\xa0million in multiyear funding commitments thus far the new project developed from funding relationships which the paper already had with the ford rockefeller and bill and melinda gates foundation gates had given the organization 5 million for its global development webpage as of march 2020 the journal claims to be the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels founded by textile traders and merchants in its early years the guardian had a reputation as an organ of the middle class or in the words of c p scotts son ted a paper that will remain bourgeois to the last associated at first with the little circle and hence with classical liberalism as expressed by the whigs and later by the liberal party its political orientation underwent a decisive change after world war ii leading to a gradual alignment with labour and the political left in general the scott trust describes one of its core purposes to be to secure the financial and editorial independence of the guardian in perpetuity as a quality national newspaper without party affiliation remaining faithful to its liberal tradition the papers readership is generally on the mainstream left of british political opinion a mori poll taken between april and june 2000 showed that 80 per cent of guardian readers were labour party voters according to another mori poll taken in 2005 48 per cent of guardian readers were labour voters and 34 per cent liberal democrat voters the term guardian reader can be used to imply a stereotype of liberal leftwing or politically correct views although the paper is often considered to be linked inextricably to the labour party three of the guardians four leader writers joined the more centrist social democratic party on its foundation in 1981 the paper was enthusiastic in its support for tony blair in his successful bid to lead the labour party and to be elected prime minister on 19 january 2003 two months before the 2003 invasion of iraq an observer editorial said military intervention in the middle east holds many dangers but if we want a lasting peace it may be the only option  war with iraq may yet not come but conscious of the potentially terrifying responsibility resting with the british government we find ourselves supporting the current commitment to a possible use of force the guardian however opposed the war along with the daily mirror and the independent then guardian features editor ian katz asserted in 2004 that it is no secret we are a centreleft newspaper in 2008 guardian columnist jackie ashley said that editorial contributors were a mix of rightofcentre libertarians greens blairites brownites labourite but less enthusiastic brownites etc and that the newspaper was clearly left of centre and vaguely progressive she also said that you can be absolutely certain that come the next general election the guardians stance will not be dictated by the editor still less any foreign proprietor it helps that there isnt one but will be the result of vigorous debate within the paper the papers comment and opinion pages though often written by centreleft contributors such as polly toynbee have allowed some space for rightofcentre voices such as sir max hastings and michael gove since an editorial in 2000 the guardian has favoured abolition of the british monarchy i write for the guardian said max hastings in 2005 because it is read by the new establishment reflecting the papers thengrowing influence in the runup to the 2010 general election following a meeting of the editorial staff the paper declared its support for the liberal democrats due in particular to the partys stance on electoral reform the paper suggested tactical voting to prevent a conservative victory given britains firstpastthepost electoral system at the 2015 election the paper switched its support to the labour party the paper argued that britain needed a new direction and labour speaks with more urgency than its rivals on social justice standing up to predatory capitalism on investment for growth on reforming and strengthening the public realm britains place in europe and international development assistant editor michael white in discussing media selfcensorship in march 2011 says i have always sensed liberal middle class illease in going after stories about immigration legal or otherwise about welfare fraud or the less attractive tribal habits of the working class which is more easily ignored altogether toffs including royal ones christians especially popes governments of israel and us republicans are more straightforward targets in a 2013 interview for npr the guardians latin america correspondent rory carroll stated that many editors at the guardian believed and continue to believe that they should support hugo chávez because he was a standardbearer for the left in the 2015 united kingdom general election it endorsed the labour party in the 2015 labour party leadership election the guardian supported blairite candidate yvette cooper and was critical of leftwinger jeremy corbyn the successful candidate these positions were criticised by the morning star which accused the guardian of being conservativeundue weight  – discuss although the majority of guardian columnists were against corbyn winning owen jones seumas milne and george monbiot wrote supportive articles about him despite the critical position of the paper in general the guardian endorsed the labour party while corbyn was its leader in the 2017 and 2019 general elections — although in both cases they endorsed a vote for opposition parties other than labour such as the liberal democrats and the scottish national party in seats where labour did not stand a chance in the 2016 united kingdom european union membership referendum the guardian endorsed

year the publishers stopped making circulation data public the first edition was published on 5 may 1821 at which time the guardian was a weekly published on saturdays and costing 7d the stamp duty on newspapers 4d per sheet forced the price up so high that it was uneconomic to publish more frequently when the stamp duty was cut in 1836 the guardian added a wednesday edition and with the abolition of the tax in 1855 it became a daily paper costing 2d in october 1952 the paper took the step of printing news on the front page replacing the adverts that had hitherto filled that space theneditor a p wadsworth wrote it is not a thing i like myself but it seems to be accepted by all the newspaper pundits that it is preferable to be in fashion following the closure of the anglican church newspaper the guardian in 1951 the paper dropped manchester from its title in 1959 becoming simply the guardian in 1964 it moved to london losing some of its regional agenda but continuing to be heavily subsidised by sales of the more downmarket but more profitable manchester evening news the financial position remained extremely poor into the 1970s at one time it was in merger talks with the times the paper consolidated its centreleft stance during the 1970s and 1980scitation needed on 12 february 1988 the guardian had a significant redesign as well as improving the quality of its printers ink it also changed its masthead to a juxtaposition of an italic garamond the with a bold helvetica guardian that remained in use until the 2005 redesign in 1992 the guardian relaunched its features section as g2 a tabloidformat supplement this innovation was widely copied by the other quality broadsheets and ultimately led to the rise of compact papers and the guardians move to the berliner format in 1993 the paper declined to participate in the broadsheet price war started by rupert murdochs the times in june 1993 the guardian bought the observer from lonrho thus gaining a serious sunday sister newspaper with similar political views its international weekly edition is now titled the guardian weekly though it retained the title manchester guardian weekly for some years after the home edition had moved to london it includes sections from a number of other internationally significant newspapers of a somewhat leftofcentre inclination including le monde and the washington post the guardian weekly was also linked to a website for expatriates guardian abroad which was launched in 2007 but had been taken offline by 2012 the guardian is printed in full colour and was the first newspaper in the uk to use the berliner format for its main section while producing sections and supplements in a range of page sizes including tabloid approximately a4 and pocketsize approximately a5 in 2004 the guardian announced plans to change to a berliner or midi format similar to that used by die tageszeitung in germany le monde in france and many other european papers at 470×315\\xa0mm this is slightly larger than a traditional tabloid planned for the autumn of 2005 this change followed moves by the independent and the times to start publishing in tabloid or compact format on thursday 1

by mark porter the new look includes a new masthead for the newspaper its first since 1988 a typeface family designed by paul barnes and christian schwartz was created for the new design with just

both text and headlines and is central to the redesign the switch cost guardian newspapers £80\\xa0million and involved setting up new printing presses in east london and manchester this switch was necessary because before the guardians move no printing presses in britain could produce newspapers in the berliner format there were additional complications as one of the papers presses was partowned by telegraph newspapers and express newspapers contracted to use the plant until 2009 another press was shared with the guardian media groups northwestern tabloid local papers which did not wish to switch to the berliner format the new format was generally well received by guardian readers who were encouraged to provide feedback on the changes the only controversy was over the dropping of the doonesbury cartoon strip the paper reported thousands of calls and emails complaining about its loss within 24 hours the decision was reversed and the strip was reinstated the following week g2 supplement editor ian katz who was responsible for dropping it apologised in the editors blog saying im sorry once again that i made you—and the hundreds of fellow fans who have called our helpline or mailed our comments address—so cross however some readers were dissatisfied as the earlier deadline needed for the allcolour sports section meant coverage of latefinishing evening football matches became less satisfactory in the editions supplied to some parts of the country the investment was rewarded with a circulation rise in december 2005 the average daily sale stood at 380693 nearly 6 per

printing to presses owned by trinity mirror is expected to save millions of pounds annually the move is part of a threeyear plan that includes cutting 300 jobs in an attempt to reduce losses and break even by 2019 the paper and ink are the same as previously and the font size is fractionally larger an assessment of the response from readers in late april 2018 indicated that the new format had led

multimedia in association with arte in 2004 the paper also launched a dating website guardian soulmates on 1 july 2020 guardian soulmates was closed down with the explanation it hasnt been an easy

the papers nickname the grauniad sometimes abbreviated as graun originated with the satirical magazine private eye this anagram played on the guardians early reputation for frequent typographical errors including misspelling its own name as the gaurdian the first issue of the newspaper contained a number of errors including a notification that there would soon be some goods sold at atction instead of auction fewer typographical errors are seen in the paper since the end of hotmetal typesetting one guardian writer keith devlin suggested that the high number of observed misprints was due more to the quality of the readership than the misprints greater frequency the newspaper was printed in manchester until 1961 and the fact that the prints sent to london by train were the early more errorprone prints may have contributed to this image as well when john cole was appointed news editor by alastair hetherington in 1963 he sharpened the papers comparatively amateurish setup employees

difficult conditions under which it was constructed it is often referred to as the eighth wonder of the world the highway is also a part of the asian highway ah4 the karakoram highway also known as the friendship highway in china was built by the governments of pakistan and china it was started in 1962 and was completed and opened to the public in 1978 pakistan initially favored routing through mintaka pass in 1966 china citing the fact that mintaka would be more susceptible to air strikes recommended the steeper khunjerab pass instead about 810 pakistanis and about 200 chinese workers died mostly in landslides and falls while building the highway over 140 chinese workers who died during the construction are buried in the chinese cemetery in gilgit the route of the kkh traces one of the

highway cuts through the collision zone between the eurasian and indian plates where china tajikistan afghanistan and pakistan come within 250\\xa0km 160\\xa0mi of each other owing largely to the extremely sensitive state of the kashmir conflict between india and pakistan the karakoram highway has strategic and military importance to these nations but particularly pakistan and china on 30 june 2006 a memorandum of understanding was signed between the pakistani national highway authority nha and chinas stateowned assets supervision and administration commission sasac to rebuild and upgrade the karakoram highway according to sasac the width will be expanded from 10 to 30\\xa0m 33 to 98\\xa0ft and its transport capacity will be increased three times its current capacity in addition the

2010 that created attabad lake the resulting landslides cut off both the hunza river and karakoram highway resulting in the formation of the reservoir prior to the completion of the bypass all vehicular traffic had to be loaded onto boats to traverse the new reservoir construction of the tunnels began in 2012 and required 36 months for completion the 24\\xa0km 15\\xa0mi long series of bridges and tunnels was inaugurated on 15 september 2015 at a cost of 275\\xa0millionclarification needed and was hailed as a major accomplishment the route comprises five tunnels and several bridges

at least 40000 people mohenjodaro prospered until around 1700 bce mohenjodaro was abandoned in the 19th century bce as the indus valley civilization declined and the site was not rediscovered until the 1920s significant excavation has since been conducted at the site of the city which was designated a unesco world heritage site in 1980 the first site in south asia to be so designated the site is currently threatened by erosion and improper restoration the citys original name is unknown based on his analysis of a mohenjodaro seal iravatham mahadevan speculates that the citys ancient name could have been kukkuṭārma the city rma of the cockerel kukkutacitation needed cockfighting may have had ritual and religious significance for the citycitation needed mohenjodaro may also have been a point

developed around 3000 bce from the prehistoric indus culture at its height the indus civilization spanned much of what is now pakistan and north india extending westwards to the iranian border south to gujarat in india and northwards to an outpost in bactria with major urban centers at harappa mohenjodaro lothal kalibangan dholavira and rakhigarhi mohenjodaro was the most advanced city of its time with remarkably sophisticated civil engineering and urban planning when the indus civilization went into sudden decline around 1900 bce mohenjodaro was abandoned the ruins of the city remained undocumented for around 3700 years until r d banerji an officer of the archaeological survey of india visited the site in 1919–20 identifying what he thought to be a buddhist stupa 150–500 ce known to be there and finding a flint scraper which convinced him of the sites antiquity this led to largescale excavations of mohenjodaro led by k n dikshit in 1924–25 and john marshall in 1925–26 in the 1930s major excavations were conducted at the site under the leadership of marshall d k dikshitar and ernest mackay further excavations were carried out in 1945 by mortimer wheeler and his trainee ahmad hasan dani the last major series of excavations were conducted in 1964 and 1965 by george f dales after 1965 excavations were banned due to weathering damage to the exposed structures and the only projects allowed at the site since have been salvage excavations surface surveys and conservation projects in the 1980s german and italian survey groups led by michael jansen and maurizio tosi used less invasive archeological techniques such as architectural documentation surface surveys and localized probing to gather further information about mohenjodaro a dry core drilling conducted in 2015 by pakistans national fund for mohenjodaro revealed that the site is larger than the unearthed area mohenjodaro has a planned layout with rectilinear buildings arranged on a grid plan most were built of fired and mortared brick some incorporated sundried mudbrick and wooden superstructures the covered area of mohenjodaro is estimated at 300 hectares the oxford handbook of cities in world history offers a weak estimate of a peak population of around 40000 the sheer size of the city and its provision of public buildings and facilities suggests a high level of social organization the city is divided into two parts the socalled citadel and the lower city the citadel – a mudbrick mound around 12 metres 39\\xa0ft high – is known to have supported public baths a large residential structure designed to house about 5000 citizens and two large assembly halls the city had a central marketplace with a large central well individual households or groups of households obtained their water from smaller wells waste water was channeled to covered drains that lined the major streets some houses presumably those of more prestigious  inhabitants include rooms that appear to have been set aside for bathing and one building had an underground furnace known as a hypocaust possibly for heated bathing most houses had inner courtyards with doors that opened onto sidelanes some buildings had two storiescitation needed in 1950 sir mortimer wheeler identified one large building in mohenjodaro as a great granary certain walldivisions in its massive wooden superstructure appeared to be grain storagebays complete with airducts to dry the grain according to wheeler carts would have brought grain from the countryside and unloaded them directly into the bays however jonathan mark kenoyer noted the complete lack of evidence for grain at the granary which he argued might therefore be better termed a great hall of uncertain function close to the great granary is a large and elaborate public bath sometimes called the great bath from a colonnaded courtyard steps lead down to the brickbuilt pool which was waterproofed by a lining of bitumen the pool measures 12 metres 39\\xa0ft long 7 metres 23\\xa0ft wide and 24 metres 79\\xa0ft deep it may have been used for religious purification other large buildings include a pillared hall thought to be an assembly hall of some kind and the socalled college hall a complex of buildings comprising 78 rooms thought to have been a priestly residencecitation needed mohenjodaro had no series of city walls but was fortified with guard towers to the west of the main settlement and defensive fortifications to the south considering these fortifications and the structure of other major indus valley cities like harappa it is postulated that mohenjodaro was an administrative center both harappa and mohenjodaro share relatively the same architectural layout and were generally not heavily fortified like other indus valley sites it is obvious from the identical city layouts of all indus sites that there was some kind of political or administrative centrality but the extent and functioning of an administrative center remains unclear the location of mohenjodaro was built in a relatively short period of time with the water supply system and wells being some of the first planned constructions\\n with the excavations done so far over 700 wells are present at mohenjodaro alongside drainage and bathing systems this number is unheard of when compared to other civilizations at the time such as egypt or mesopotamia and the quantity of wells transcribes as one well for every three houses because of the large number of wells it is believed that the inhabitants relied solely on annual rainfall as well as the indus rivers course remaining close to the site alongside the wells providing water for long periods of time in the case of the city coming under siege due to the period in which these wells were built and used it is likely that the circular brick well design used at this and many other harappan sites are an invention that should be credited to the indus civilization as there is no existing evidence of this design from mesopotamia or egypt at this time and even later sewage and waste water for buildings at the site were disposed of via a centralized drainage system that ran alongside the sites streets these drains that ran alongside the road were effective at allowing most human waste and sewage to be disposed of as the drains most likely took the waste toward the indus river the city also had large platforms perhaps intended as defense against flooding according to a theory first advanced by wheeler the city could have been flooded and silted over perhaps six times and later rebuilt in the same location for some archaeologists it was believed that a final flood that helped engulf the city in a sea of mud brought about the abandonment of the site gregory possehl was the first to theorize that the floods were caused by overuse and expansion upon the land and that the mud flood was not the reason the site was abandoned instead of a mud flood wiping part of the city out in one fell swoop possehl coined the possibility of constant minifloods throughout the year paired with the land being worn out by crops pastures and resources for bricks and pottery spelled the downfall of the site numerous objects found in excavation include seated and standing figures copper and stone tools carved seals balancescales and weights gold and jasper jewellery and childrens toys many bronze and copper pieces such as figurines and bowls have been recovered from the site showing that the inhabitants of mohenjodaro understood how to utilize the lost wax technique the furnaces found at the site are believed to have been used for copperworks and melting the metals as opposed to smelting there even seems to be an entire section of the city dedicated to shellworking located in the northeastern part of the site some of the most prominent copperworks recovered from the site are the copper tablets which have examples of the untranslated indus script and iconography while the script has not been deciphered yet many of the images on the tablets match another tablet and both hold the same caption in the indus language with the example given showing three tablets with the image of a mountain goat and the inscription on the back reading the same letters for the three tablets pottery and terracotta sherds have been recovered from the site with many of the pots having deposits of ash in them leading archeologists to believe they were either used to hold the ashes of a person or as a way to warm up a home located in the site these heaters or braziers were ways to heat the house while also being able to be utilized in a manner of cooking or straining while others solely believe they were used for heating the finds from mohenjodaro were initially deposited in the lahore museum but later moved to the asi headquarters at new delhi where a new central imperial museum was being planned for the new capital of the british raj in which at least a selection would be displayed  it became apparent that indian independence was approaching but the partition of india was not anticipated until late in the process  the new pakistani authorities requested the return of the harappan pieces excavated on their territory but the indian authorities refused  eventually an agreement was reached whereby the finds totalling some 12000 objects most sherds of pottery were split equally between the countries in some cases this was taken very literally with some necklaces and girdles having their beads separated into two piles  in the case of the two most celebrated sculpted figures pakistan asked for and received the priestking while india retained the much smaller dancing girl and also the pashupati seal most of the objects from mohenjodaro retained by india are in the national museum of india in new delhi and those returned to pakistan in the national museum of pakistan in karachi with many also in the museum now established at mohenjodaro itself in 1939 a small representative group of artefacts excavated at the site was transferred to the british museum by the directorgeneral of the archaeological survey of india discovered by john marshall in 1931 the idol appears to mimic certain characteristics that match the mother goddess belief common in many early near east civilizations sculptures and figurines depicting women have been observed as part of harappan culture and religion as multiple female pieces were recovered from marshalls archaeological digs these figures were not categorized correctly according to marshall meaning that where they were recovered from the site is not actually clear one of said figures is 187\\xa0cm tall and is currently on display at the national museum of pakistan in karachi the fertility and motherhood aspects on display on the idols is represented by the female genitalia that is presented in an almost exaggerated style as stated by marshall with him inferring that such figurines are offerings to the goddess as opposed to the typical understanding of them being idols representing the goddesss likeness because of the figurines being unique in terms of hairstyles body proportions as well as headdresses and jewelry there are theories as to who these figurines actually represent shereen ratnagar theorizes that because of their uniqueness and dispersed discovery throughout the site that they could be figurines of ordinary household women who commissioned these pieces to be used in rituals or healing ceremonies to help aforementioned individual women a bronze statuette dubbed the dancing girl 105 centimetres 41\\xa0in high and about 4500 years old was found in hr area of mohenjodaro in 1926 it is now in the national museum new delhi in 1973 british archaeologist mortimer wheeler described the item as his favorite statuette shes about fifteen years old i should think not more but she stands there with bangles all the way up her arm and nothing else on a girl perfectly for the moment perfectly confident of herself and the world theres nothing like her i think in the world john marshall another archeologist at mohenjodaro described the figure as a young girl her hand on her hip in a halfimpudent posture and legs slightly forward as she beats time to the music with her legs and feet the archaeologist gregory possehl said of the statuette we may not be certain that she was a dancer but she was good at what she did and she knew it the statue led to two important discoveries about the civilization first that they knew metal blending casting and other sophisticated methods of working with ore and secondly that entertainment especially dance was part of the culture in 1927 a seated male soapstone figure was found in a building with unusually ornamental brickwork and a wallniche though there is no evidence that priests or monarchs ruled mohenjodaro archaeologists dubbed this dignified figure a priestking the sculpture is 175 centimetres 69\\xa0in tall and shows a neatly bearded man with pierced earlobes and a fillet around his head possibly all that is left of a onceelaborate hairstyle or headdress his hair is combed back he wears an armband and a cloak with drilled trefoil single circle and double circle motifs which show traces of red his eyes might have originally been inlaid a seal discovered at the site bears the image of a seated crosslegged and possibly ithyphallic figure surrounded by animals the figure has been interpreted by some scholars as a yogi and by others as a threeheaded protoshiva as lord of animals sir mortimer wheeler was especially fascinated with this artifact which he believed to be at least 4500 years old the necklace has an sshaped clasp with seven strands each over 4\\xa0ft long of bronzemetal beadlike nuggets which connect each arm of the s in filigree each strand has between 220 and 230 of the manyfaceted nuggets and there are about 1600 nuggets in total the necklace weighs about 250 grams in total and is presently held in a private collection in indiacitation needed the indus valley civilization employed rulers made of ivory for measuring length circa 1500\\xa0bce the mohenjodaro ruler is divided into units corresponding to 34 millimetres 132\\xa0in and these are further marked in decimal subdivisions with great accuracy to within 013\\xa0mm 0005\\xa0in a ruler found at lothal 2400\\xa0bce is calibrated to about 16\\xa0mm 1⁄16\\xa0in the decimal subdivision on the ruler is noteworthy as it predates the modern metric system by 3000 years or more the base unit used was known as the angula finger and is about 17\\xa0mm a piece of shell found in mackays excavation is very precisely incised with lines spaced 67\\xa0mm 0264\\xa0in apart ancient bricks found throughout the region have dimensions that correspond to these units an initial agreement to fund restoration was agreed through the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco in paris on 27 may 1980  contributions were made by a number of other countries to the project preservation work for mohenjodaro was suspended in december 1996 after funding from the pakistani government and international organizations stopped site conservation work resumed in april 1997 using funds made available by the unesco the 20year funding plan provided 10 million to protect the site and standing structures from flooding in 2011 responsibility for the preservation of the site was transferred to the government of sindh currently the site is threatened by groundwater salinity and improper restoration many walls have already collapsed while others are crumbling from the ground up in 2012 pakistani archaeologists warned that without improved conservation measures the site could disappear by 2030 the mohenjodaro site was further threatened in january 2014 when bilawal bhutto zardari of the pakistan peoples party chose the site for sindh festivals inauguration ceremony this would have exposed the site to mechanical operations including excavation and drilling farzand masih head of the department of archaeology at punjab university warned that such activity was banned under the antiquity act saying you cannot even hammer a nail at an archaeological site  on 31 january 2014 a case was filed in the sindh high court to bar the sindh government from continuing with the event the festival was held by ppp at the historic site despite all the protest by both national and international historians and educators mohenjodaro has a hot desert climate köppen climate classification bwh with extremely hot summers and mild winters the highest recorded temperature is 535\\xa0°c 1283\\xa0°f recorded in may 2010 and the lowest recorded temperature is −54\\xa0°c 223\\xa0°f recorded in

rainfall ever is 10238\\xa0mm recorded in 2022 and the lowest annual rainfall ever is 10\\xa0mm recorded in 1987 harappa punjabi pronunciation ɦəɽəppaː urdupunjabi ہڑپّہ is an archaeological site in punjab pakistan about 24\\xa0km 15\\xa0mi west of sahiwal  the bronze age harappan civilisation now more often called the indus valley civilisation is named after the site which takes its name from a modern village near the former course of the ravi river which now runs 8\\xa0km 50\\xa0mi to the north the core of the harappan civilization extended over a large area from gujarat in the south across sindh and rajasthan and extending into punjab and haryana numerous sites have been found outside the core area including some as far east as uttar pradesh and as far west as sutkagendor on the makran coast of balochistan not far from iran the site of the ancient city contains the ruins of a bronze age fortified city which was part of the harappan civilisation centred in sindh and the punjab and then the cemetery h culture the city is believed to have had as many as 23500 residents and occupied about 150 hectares 370 acres with clay brick houses at its greatest extent during the mature harappan phase 2600 bc – 1900\\xa0bc which is considered large for its time per archaeological convention of naming a previously unknown civilisation by its first excavated site the indus valley civilisation is also called the harappan civilisation the ancient city of harappa was heavily damaged under british and french rule when bricks from the ruins were used as track ballast in the construction of the lahore–multan railwaycitation needed the current village of harappa is less than 1\\xa0km 062\\xa0mi from the ancient site although modern harappa has a legacy railway station from the british raj period it is a small crossroads town of 15000 people today  in 2005 a controversial amusement park scheme at the site was abandoned when builders unearthed many archaeological artefacts during the early stages of building work the harappan civilisation has its earliest roots in cultures such as that of mehrgarh approximately 6000 bc the two greatest cities mohenjodaro and harappa emerged c\\u20092600 bc along the indus river valley in punjab and sindh the civilisation with a possible writing system urban centres drainage infrastructure and diversified social and economic system was rediscovered in the 1920s also after excavations at mohenjodaro in sindh near larkana and harappa in west punjab south of lahore a number of other sites stretching from the himalayan foothills in the east punjab india in the north to gujarat in the south and east and to pakistani balochistan in the west have also been discovered and studied although the archaeological site at harappa was damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the lahoremultan railroad used brick from the harappa ruins for track ballast an abundance of artefacts have nevertheless been found\\nbecause of the reducing sealevels certain regions in late harappan period were abandoned \\n towards the end harappan civilisation lost features such as writing and hydraulic engineering as a result the ganges valley settlement gained prominence and ganges cities developed the earliest recognisably harappan sites date to 3500 bc this early phase lasts till around 2600 bc we then enter the mature phase from 2600 bc to 2000 bc this is when the great cities were at their height then from around 2000 bc we have a steady disintegration that lasts till 1400 bc – what is usually called late harappan there is no sign that the harappan cities were laid waste by invaders the evidence strongly points to natural causes a number of studies show that the area which is today the thar desert was once far wetter and that the climate gradually became drier the indus valley civilization was basically an urban culture sustained by surplus agricultural production and commerce the latter including trade with elam and sumer in southern mesopotamia both mohenjodaro and harappa are generally characterised as having differentiated living quarters flatroofed brick houses and fortified administrative or religious centers although such similarities have given rise to arguments for the existence of a standardised system of urban layout and planning the similarities are largely due to the presence of a semiorthogonal type of civic layout and a comparison of the layouts of mohenjodaro and harappa shows that they are in fact arranged in a quite dissimilar fashion the weights and measures of the indus valley civilisation on the other hand were highly standardised and conform to a set scale of gradations distinctive seals were used among other applications perhaps for the identification of property and shipment of goods although copper and bronze were in use iron was not yet employed cotton was woven and dyed for clothing wheat rice and a variety of vegetables and fruits were cultivated and a number of animals including the humped bull was domesticated as well as fowl for fighting  wheelmade pottery—some of it adorned with animal and geometric motifs—has been found in profusion at all the major indus sites a centralised administration for each city though not the whole civilisation has been inferred from the revealed cultural uniformity however it remains uncertain whether authority lay with a commercial oligarchy harappans had many trade routes along the indus river that went as far as the persian gulf mesopotamia and egypt some of the most valuable things traded were carnelian and lapis lazuli what is clear is that harappan society was not entirely peaceful with the human skeletal remains demonstrating some of the highest rates of injury 155 found in south asian prehistory examinations of harappan skeletons have often found wounds that are likely to have been inflicted in battle paleopathological analysis demonstrated that leprosy and tuberculosis were present at harappa with the highest prevalence of both disease and trauma present in the skeletons from area g an ossuary located southeast of the city walls furthermore rates of craniofacial trauma and infection increased through time demonstrating that the civilisation collapsed amid illness and injury the bioarchaeologists who examined the remains have suggested that the combined evidence for differences in mortuary treatment and epidemiology indicate that some individuals and communities at harappa were excluded from access to basic resources like health and safety the harappans had traded with ancient mesopotamia especially elam among other areas cotton textiles and agricultural products were the primary trading objects the harappan merchants also had procurement colonies in mesopotamia as well which served as trading centres they also traded extensively with people living in southern india near modernday karnataka to procure gold and copper from themcitation needed the excavators of the site have proposed the following chronology of harappas occupation period 1 occupation was thought to be around 7 to 10 hectares but following excavations and findings of pottery in mound e along with previously found mound ab pottery suggest ravihakra phase would have been extended together in both mounds to 25 hectares period 2 kot diji phase was extended in the same two mounds ab and e covering over 27 hectares in period 3 harappa phase the settlement reached 150 hectares by far the most exquisite and obscure artefacts unearthed to date are the small square steatite soapstone seals engraved with human or animal motifs a large number of seals have been found at such sites as mohenjodaro and harappa many bear pictographic inscriptions generally thought to be a form of writing or scriptcitation needed despite the efforts of philologists from all parts of the world and despite the use of modern cryptographic analysis the signs remain undeciphered it is also unknown if they reflect protodravidian or other nonvedic languages the ascribing of indus valley civilisation iconography and epigraphy to historically known cultures is extremely problematic in part due to the rather tenuous archaeological evidence for such claims as well as the projection of modern south asian political concerns onto the archaeological record of the area this is especially evident in the radically varying interpretations of harappan material culture as seen from both pakistan and indiabased scholarsoriginal researchcitation needed in february 2006 a school teacher in the village of sembiankandiyur in tamil nadu discovered a stone celt tool with an inscription estimated to be up to 3500 years old\\n indian epigraphist iravatham mahadevan postulated that the four signs were in the indus script and called the find the greatest archaeological discovery of a century in tamil nadu based on this evidence he goes on to suggest that the language used in the indus valley was of dravidian origin however the absence of a bronze age in south india contrasted with the knowledge of bronze making techniques in the indus valley cultures calls into question the validity of this hypothesis the area of the late harappan period consisted of areas of daimabad maharashtra and badakshan regions of afghanistan the area covered by this civilisation would have been very large with a distance of around 2400 kilometres 1500\\xa0mi clay and stone tablets unearthed at harappa which were carbondated 3300–3200\\xa0bc contain tridentshaped and plantlike markings it is a big question as to if we can call what we have found true writing but we have found symbols that have similarities to what became indus script said dr richard meadow of harvard university director of the harappa archeological research project these primitive symbols are\\nplaced slightly earlier than the primitive writing of the sumerians of mesopotamia dated c3100\\xa0bc these markings have similarities to what later became indus script which has not been completely deciphered yet k2 at 8611 metres 28251\\xa0ft above sea level is the secondhighest mountain on earth after mount everest at

taxkorgan tajik autonomous county of xinjianga k2 also became popularly known as the savage mountain after george bell—a climber on the 1953 american expedition—told reporters its a savage mountain that tries to kill you of the five highest mountains in the world k2 is the deadliest approximately one person dies on the mountain for every four who reach the summit also occasionally known as mount godwinausten other nicknames for k2 are the king of mountains and the mountaineers mountain as well as the mountain of mountains after prominent italian climber reinhold messner titled his book about k2 the same although the summit of everest is at a higher altitude k2 is a more difficult and dangerous climb due in part to its more northern location where inclement weather is more common the summit was reached for the first time by the italian climbers lino lacedelli and achille compagnoni on the 1954 italian expedition led by ardito desio as of february\\xa02021update only 377 people have summited k2 there have been 91 deaths during attempted climbs most ascents are made during july and august typically the warmest times of the year but in january 2021 k2 became the final eightthousander to be summited in the winter the mountaineering feat was accomplished by a team of nepalese climbers led by nirmal purja and mingma gyalje sherpa k2 has now been climbed by almost all of its ridges but unlike other eightthousanders never from its eastern face the name k2 is derived from the notation used by the great trigonometrical survey of british india thomas montgomerie made the first survey of the karakoram from mount haramukh some 210\\xa0km 130\\xa0mi to the south and sketched the two most prominent peaks labelling them k1 and k2 where the k stands for karakoram the policy of the great trigonometrical survey was to use local names for mountains wherever possibleb and k1 was found to be known locally as masherbrum k2 however appeared not to have acquired a local name possibly due to its remoteness the mountain is not visible from askole one of the highest settlements on the way to the mountain nor from the nearest habitation to the north k2 is only fleetingly glimpsed from the end of the baltoro glacier beyond which few local people would have ventured the name chogori derived from two balti words chhogo ཆོ་གྷའོ་ big and ri རི mountain چھوغوری has been suggested as a local name but evidence for its widespread use is scant it may have been a compound name invented by western explorers or simply a bemused reply to the question whats that called it does however form the basis for the name qogir simplified chinese 乔戈里峰 traditional chinese 喬戈里峰 pinyin qiáogēlǐ fēng by which chinese authorities officially refer to the peak other local names have been suggested including lamba pahar tall mountain in urdu and dapsang but these are not widely used with the mountain lacking a local name the name mount godwinausten was suggested in honour of henry godwinausten an early explorer of the area while the name was rejected by the royal geographical society it was used on several maps and continues to be used occasionally the surveyors mark k2 therefore continues to be the name by which the mountain is commonly known it is now also used in the balti language rendered as kechu or ketu balti کے چو urdu کے ٹو the italian climber fosco maraini argued in his account of the ascent of gasherbrum iv that while the name of k2 owes its origin to chance its clipped impersonal nature is highly appropriate for so remote and challenging a mountain he concluded that it was \\xa0just the bare bones of a name all rock and ice and storm and abyss it makes no attempt to sound human it is atoms and stars it has the nakedness of the world before the first man—or of the cindered planet after the last andré weil named k3 surfaces in mathematics partly after the beauty of the mountain k2 k2 lies in the northwestern karakoram range it is located in the baltistan region of gilgit–baltistan pakistan and the taxkorgan tajik autonomous county of xinjiang chinaa the tarim sedimentary basin borders the range on the north and the lesser himalayas on the south melt waters from glaciers such as those south and east of k2 feed agriculture in the valleys and contribute significantly to the regional freshwater supplycitation needed k2 is ranked 22nd by topographic prominence a measure of a mountains independent stature it is a part of the same extended area of uplift including the karakoram the tibetan plateau and the himalayas as mount everest and it is possible to follow a path from k2 to everest that goes no lower than 4594 metres 15072\\xa0ft at the kora la on the nepalchina border in the mustang lo many other peaks far lower than k2 are more independent in this sense it is however the most prominent peak within the karakoram range k2 is notable for its local relief as well as its total height it stands over 3000 metres 9840\\xa0ft above much of the glacial valley bottoms at its base it is a consistently steep pyramid dropping quickly in almost all directions the north side is the steepest there it rises over 3200 metres

13000\\xa0ft a 1986 expedition led by george wallerstein made an inaccurate measurement showing that k2 was taller than mount everest and therefore the tallest mountain in the world a corrected measurement was made in 1987 but by then the claim that k2 was the tallest mountain in the world had already made it into many news reports and reference works k2s height given on maps and encyclopedias is 8611 metres 28251\\xa0ft in the summer of 2014 a pakistaniitalian expedition to k2 named k2 60 years later was organized to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the first ascent of k2 one of the goals of the expedition was to accurately measure the height of the mountain using satellite navigation the height of k2 measured during this expedition was 860902 metres 282448\\xa0ft the mountains of k2 and broad peak and the area westward to the lower reaches of sarpo laggo glacier consist of metamorphic rocks known as the k2 gneiss and part of the karakoram metamorphic complex the k2 gneiss consists of a mixture of orthogneiss and biotiterich paragneiss on the south and southeast face of k2 the orthogneiss consists of a mixture of a strongly foliated plagioclasehornblende gneiss and a biotitehornblendekfeldspar orthogneiss which has been intruded by garnetmica leucogranitic dikes in places the paragneisses include clinopyroxenehornblendebearing psammites garnet grossulardiopside marbles and biotitegraphite phyllites near the memorial to the climbers who have died on k2 above base camp on the south spur thin impure marbles with quartzites and mica schists called the gilkeypuchoz sequence are interbanded within the orthogneisses on the west face of broad peak and the south spur of k2 lamprophyre dikes which consist of clinopyroxene and biotiteporphyritic vogesites and minettes have intruded the k2 gneiss the k2 gneiss is separated from the surrounding sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks of the surrounding karakoram metamorphic complex by normal faults for example a fault separates the k2 gneiss of the east face of k2 from limestones and slates comprising nearby skyang kangri 40ar39ar ages of 115 to 120\\xa0million years ago obtained from and geochemical analyses of the k2 gneiss demonstrate that it is a metamorphosed older cretaceous precollisional granite the granitic precursor protolith to the k2 gneiss originated as the result of the production of large bodies of magma by a northwarddipping subduction zone along what was the continental margin of asia at that time and their intrusion as batholiths into its lower continental crust during the initial collision of the asia and indian plates this granitic batholith was buried to depths of about 20 kilometres 12\\xa0mi or more highly metamorphosed highly deformed and partially remelted during the eocene period to form gneiss later the k2 gneiss was then intruded by leucogranite dikes and finally exhumed and uplifted along major breakback thrust faults during postmiocene time the k2 gneiss was exposed as the entire k2broad peakgasherbrum range experienced rapid uplift with which erosion rates have been unable to keep pace the mountain was first surveyed by a british team in 1856 team member thomas montgomerie designated the mountain k2 for being the second peak of the karakoram range the other peaks were originally named k1 k3 k4 and k5 but were eventually renamed masherbrum gasherbrum iv gasherbrum ii and gasherbrum i respectively in 1892 martin conway led a british expedition that reached concordia on the baltoro glacier the first serious attempt to climb k2 was undertaken in 1902 by oscar eckenstein aleister crowley jules jacotguillarmod heinrich pfannl victor wessely and guy knowles via the northeast ridge in the early 1900s modern transportation did not exist in the region it took fourteen days just to reach the foot of the mountain\\nafter five serious and costly attempts the team reached 6525 metres 21407\\xa0ft—although considering the difficulty of the challenge and the lack of modern climbing equipment or weatherproof fabrics crowleys statement that neither man nor beast was injured highlights the relative skill of the ascent the failures were also attributed to sickness crowley was suffering the residual effects of malaria a combination of questionable physical training personality conflicts and poor weather conditions—of 68 days spent on k2 at the time the record for the longest time spent at such an altitude only eight provided clear weather the next expedition to k2 in 1909 led by prince luigi amedeo duke of the abruzzi reached an elevation of around 6250 metres 20510\\xa0ft on the south east spur now known as the abruzzi spur or abruzzi ridge this would eventually become part of the standard route but was abandoned at the time due to its steepness and difficulty after trying and failing to find a feasible alternative route on the west ridge or the north east ridge the duke declared that k2 would never be climbed and the team switched its attention to chogolisa where the duke came within 150 metres 490\\xa0ft of the summit before being driven back by a storm the next attempt on k2 was not made until 1938 when the first american karakoram expedition led by charles houston made a reconnaissance of the mountain they concluded that the abruzzi spur was the most practical route and reached a height of around 8000 meters 26000\\xa0ft before turning back due to diminishing supplies and the threat of bad weather the following year the 1939 american expedition led by fritz wiessner came within 200 metres 660\\xa0ft of the summit but ended in disaster when dudley wolfe pasang kikuli pasang kitar and pintso disappeared high on the mountain charles houston returned to k2 to lead the 1953 american expedition the attempt failed after a storm pinned down the team for 10 days at 7800 metres 25590\\xa0ft during which time climber art gilkey became critically ill a desperate retreat followed during which pete schoening saved almost the entire team during a mass fall known simply as the belay and gilkey was killed either in an avalanche or in a deliberate attempt to avoid burdening his companions despite the retreat and tragic end the expedition has been given iconic status in mountaineering history the gilkey memorial was built in his memory at the mountains foot the 1954 italian expedition finally succeeded in ascending to the summit of k2 via the abruzzi spur on 31 july 1954 the expedition was led by ardito desio and the two climbers who reached the summit were lino lacedelli and achille compagnoni the team included a pakistani member colonel muhammad ataullah who had been a part of the 1953 american expedition also on the expedition were walter bonatti and pakistani hunza porter amir mehdi who both proved vital to the expeditions success in that they carried oxygen tanks to 8100 metres 26600\\xa0ft for lacedelli and compagnoni the ascent is controversial because lacedelli and compagnoni established their camp at a higher elevation than originally agreed with mehdi and bonatti it being too dark to ascend or descend mehdi and bonatti were forced to overnight without shelter above 8000 metres 26000\\xa0ft leaving the oxygen tanks behind as requested when they descended bonatti and mehdi survived but mehdi was hospitalised for months and had to have his toes amputated because of frostbite efforts in the 1950s to suppress these facts to protect lacedelli and compagnonis reputations as italian national heroes were later brought to light it was also revealed that the moving of the camp was deliberate a move apparently made because compagnoni feared being outshone by the younger bonatti bonatti was given the blame for mehdis hospitalisation on 9 august 1977 23 years after the italian expedition ichiro yoshizawa led the second successful ascent with ashraf aman as the first native pakistani climber the japanese expedition took the abruzzi spur and used more than 1500 porters the third ascent of k2 was in 1978 via a new route the long and corniced northeast ridge the top of the route traversed left across the east face to avoid a vertical headwall and joined the uppermost part of the abruzzi route this ascent was made by an american team led by james whittaker the summit party was louis reichardt jim wickwire john roskelley and rick ridgeway wickwire endured an overnight bivouac about 150 metres 490\\xa0ft below the summit one of the highest bivouacs in history this ascent was emotional for the american team as they saw themselves as completing a task that had been begun by the 1938 team forty years earlier another notable japanese ascent was that of the difficult north ridge on the chinese side of the peak in 1982 a team from the japan mountaineering association\\xa0ja led by isao shinkai and masatsugo konishi\\xa0ja put three members naoe sakashita hiroshi yoshino and yukihiro yanagisawa on the summit on 14 august however yanagisawa fell and died on the descent four other members of the team achieved the summit the next day the first climber to reach the summit of k2 twice was czech climber josef rakoncaj rakoncaj was a member of the 1983 italian expedition led by francesco santon which made the second successful ascent of the north ridge 31 july 1983 three years later on 5 july 1986 he reached the summit via the abruzzi spur double with broad peak west face solo as a member of agostino da polenzas international expedition the first woman to summit k2 was polish climber wanda rutkiewicz on 23 june 1986 liliane and maurice barrard who had summited later that day fell during the descent liliane barrards body was found on 19 july 1986 at the foot of the south face in 1986 two polish expeditions summited via two new routes the magic line and the polish line jerzy kukuczka and tadeusz piotrowski piotrowski fell to his death as the two were descending thirteen climbers from several expeditions died in the 1986 k2 disaster another six mountaineers died in the 1995 k2 disaster while eleven climbers died in the 2008 k2 disastercitation needed there are a number of routes on k2 of somewhat different character but they all share some key difficulties the first being the extremely high altitude and resulting lack of oxygen there is only onethird as much oxygen available to a climber on the summit of k2 as there is at sea level the second is the propensity of the mountain to experience extreme storms of several days duration which have resulted in many of the deaths on the peak the third is the steep exposed and committing nature of all routes on the mountain which makes retreat more difficult especially during a storm despite many attempts the first successful winter ascents occurred only in 2021 all major climbing routes lie on the pakistani sidecitation needed the base camp is also located on the pakistani side the standard route of ascent used by 75 of all climbers is the abruzzi spur located on the pakistani side first attempted by prince luigi amedeo duke of the abruzzi in 1909 this is the peaks southeast ridge rising above the godwinausten glacier the spur proper begins at an altitude of 5400 metres 17700\\xa0ft where advanced base camp is usually placed the route follows an alternating series of rock ribs snowice fields and some technical rock climbing on two famous features houses chimney and the black pyramid above the black pyramid dangerously exposed and difficulttonavigate slopes lead to the easily visible shoulder and thence to the summit the last major obstacle is a narrow couloir known as the bottleneck which places climbers dangerously close to a wall of seracs that form an ice cliff to the east of the summit it was partly due to the collapse of one of these seracs around 2001 that no climbers reached the summit in 2002 and 2003 between 1  2 august 2008 11 climbers from several expeditions died during a series of accidents including several ice falls in the bottleneck almost opposite the abruzzi spur is the north ridge which ascends the chinese side of the peak it is rarely climbed partly due to very difficult access involving crossing the shaksgam river which is a hazardous undertaking in contrast to the crowds of climbers and trekkers at the abruzzi basecamp usually at most two teams are encamped below the north ridge this route more technically difficult than the abruzzicitation needed ascends a long steep primarily rock ridge to high on the mountain—camp iv the eagles nest at 7900 metres 25900\\xa0ft—and then crosses a dangerously slideprone hanging glacier by a leftward climbing traverse to reach a snow couloir which accesses the summitcitation needed besides the original japanese ascent a notable ascent of the north ridge was the one in 1990 by greg child greg mortimer and steve swenson which was done alpine style above camp 2 though using some fixed ropes already put in place by a japanese team because 75 of people who climb k2 use the abruzzi spur these listed routes are rarely climbed no one has climbed the east face of the mountain due to the instability of the snow and ice formations on that side besides the east face the north face has not yet been climbed either in 2007 denis urubko and serguey samoilov intended to climb the k2s north face but they were stymied by increasingly deteriorating conditions after finding their intended route menaced by growing avalanche danger they traversed onto the normal north ridge route and summited on 2 october 2007 making the latest summer season ascent of the peak in history for most of its climbing history k2 was not usually climbed with supplemental oxygen and small relatively lightweight teams were the norm however the 2004 season saw a great increase in the use of oxygen 28 of 47 summiteers used oxygen in that year acclimatisation is essential when climbing without oxygen to avoid some degree of

serves as the launching point for trekkers summiting on the rakhiot face of the nanga parbat in 1995 the government of pakistan declared fairy meadows a national park fairy meadows is approachable by a fifteen kilometerlong jeepable trek starting from raikot bridge on karakoram highway to the village tattu tato the dangerous and narrow gravel mountain road from the bridge to the village is only open to locals who provide transportation to visitors in 2013 the world health organization declared it the seconddeadliest road on the planet from tato onward it takes about three to four hours hiking by a five kilometer trek to fairy meadows the grassland is located in the rakhiot valley at one end of the rakhiot glacier which originates from the nanga parbat and feeds a stream that finally falls in the river indus since 1992 locals have operated camping sites in the area the sixmonth tourist season at fairy meadows starts in april and continues until the end of september tourists lodge at the camping site spread over 800 hectares 2000 acres known as raikot serai the site of fairy meadows though partially developed generates about pkr 17 million revenue from tourism mainly by providing food transportation and accommodation services the road to fairy meadows was built by brigadier m aslam khan mc hj fk first commander gilgit scouts which today employs the locals the local community stopped the extraction of timber to conserve the forest and promote tourism in the area  the main attraction of this place other than the meadows itself is the view of nanga parbat mountain tourists usually hike to the base camp of the mountain from fairy meadows the grassland is surrounded by thick alpine forest the high altitude area and northfacing slopes mostly consist of coniferous forest having pinus wallichiana picea smithiana and abies pindrow trees while in the high altitude areas with little sunlight are birch and willow dwarf shrubs the southern slopes are concentrated with juniper and scrubs namely juniperus excelsa and j turkesticana in the low altitudes the major plant found is artemisia with yellow ash stone oaks and pinus gerardiana spread among it research has suggested similarities between pinus wallichiana found in the meadows with a sister species pinus peuce found in the balkans based on leaf size among mammals a few brown bears are found in the region

subject of rockcarvings in and around chilas karl jettmar suggests that chilas might have had been a buddhist sanctuary while harald hauptmann hypothesizes thalpan to be the talilo of chinese sources however in absence of excavations such claims remain in the realm of speculations during the british raj the area was known as chilas and regarded as a tribal area a subsidiary of the princely state of jammu and kashmir its original name was apparently shiltās the region was brought under the control of the maharaja of jammu and kashmir in 1851 and an agent of the kashmir durbar was stationed there in 1893 chilas was taken over by the britishrun gilgit agency an assistant political agent of the agency was stationed in chilas town the raja was soon deposed and chilas functioned as a republican community under the aegis of jirga a body of local landowning men prior to 2019 the darel district and the tangir district were part of the diamer district but were subsequently elevated to district status the jirga continues to play a significant role in governance the district is the only sunnimajority district in gilgitbaltistan before the karakoram highway was opened in 1978 the only road from the south to the town of gilgit was a rough track north from balakot to the babusar pass via kaghan naran besal and gittidas and further north from babusar gah to chilas the road up to besal

consists of the northern portion of the larger kashmir region which has been the subject of a dispute between india and pakistan since 1947 and between india and china since 1959  it borders azad kashmir to the south the province of khyber pakhtunkhwa to the west the wakhan corridor of afghanistan to the north the xinjiang region of china to the east and northeast and the indianadministered union territories of jammu and kashmir and ladakh to the southeast the region together with azad kashmir in the southwest is grouped and referred to by the united nations and other international organisations as pakistanadministered kashmirnote 1\\ngilgitbaltistan is six times larger than azad kashmir in terms of geographical area the territory of presentday gilgitbaltistan became a separate administrative unit in 1970 under the name northern areas it was formed by the amalgamation of the former gilgit agency the baltistan district and several small former princely states the largest of which were hunza and nagar in 2009 the region was renamed to gilgitbaltistan and granted limited autonomy through the selfgovernance order signed in by former pakistani president asif ali zardari a move that was reportedly intended to also empower the territorys people however scholars state that the real power rests with the governor and not with the chief minister or elected assembly much of the population of gilgitbaltistan reportedly wants the territory to become integrated with pakistan proper as a fifth province and opposes integration with the rest of the kashmir region the pakistani government had rejected calls from the territory for provincial status on the grounds that granting such a request would jeopardise pakistans demands for the entire kashmir conflict to be resolved according to all related united nations resolutions however in november 2020 pakistani prime minister imran khan announced that gilgitbaltistan would attain provisional provincial status after the 2020 gilgitbaltistan assembly election gilgitbaltistan covers an area of over 72971\\xa0km2 28174\\xa0sq mi and is highly mountainous it had an estimated population of 1249 million people in 2013

regions are found in gilgitbaltistan the main tourism activities are trekking and mountaineering and this industry has been growing in importance throughout the region the rock carvings found in various places in gilgitbaltistan especially in the passu village of hunza suggest a human presence since 2000 bc within the next few centuries of human settlement on the tibetan plateau this region became inhabited by tibetans who preceded the balti people of baltistan today baltistan bears similarity to ladakh physically and culturally although not in religion dards are found mainly in the western areas these people are the shinaspeaking peoples of gilgit chilas astore and diamir while in hunza and the upper regions burushaski and khowar speakers predominate the dards find mention in the works of herodotusnote 2 nearchus megasthenes plinynote 3 ptolemynote 4 and the geographical lists of the puranas in the 1st century the people of these regions were followers of the bon religion while in the 2nd century they practiced buddhism between 399 and 414 the chinese buddhist pilgrim faxian visited gilgitbaltistan in the 6th century somana palola greater gilgitchilas was ruled by an unknown king between 627 and 645 the chinese buddhist pilgrim xuanzang travelled through this region on his pilgrimage to india according to chinese records from the tang dynasty between the 600s and the 700s the region was governed by a buddhist dynasty referred to as bolü chinese 勃律 pinyin bólǜ also transliterated as palola patola balur they are believed to have been the patola shahis dynasty mentioned in a brahmi inscription and devout adherents of vajrayana buddhism at the time little palola chinese 小勃律 was used to refer to gilgit while great palola chinese 大勃律 was used to refer to baltistan however the records do not consistently disambiguate the two in mid600s gilgit came under chinese suzerainty after the fall of the western turkic khaganate to tang military campaigns in the region in the late 600s ce the rising tibetan empire wrestled control of the region from the chinese however faced with growing influence of the umayyad caliphate and then the abbasid caliphate to the west the tibetans were forced to ally themselves with the islamic caliphates the region was then contested by chinese and tibetan forces and their respective vassal states until the mid700s rulers of gilgit formed an alliance with the tang chinese and held back the arabs with their help between 644 and 655 navasurendrādityanandin became king of the palola sāhi dynasty in gilgit numerous sanskrit inscriptions including the danyor rock inscriptions were discovered to be from his reign in the late 600s and early 700s jayamaṅgalavikramādityanandin was king of gilgit according to chinese court records in 717 and 719 respectively delegations of a ruler of great palola baltistan named sufushelijilini chinese 蘇弗舍利支離泥 pinyin sūfúshèlìzhīlíní reached the chinese imperial court by at least 719720 ladakh mard became part of the tibetan empire by that time buddhism was practised in baltistan and sanskrit was the written language in 720 the delegation of surendrāditya chinese 蘇麟陀逸之 pinyin sūlíntuóyìzhī reached the chinese imperial court he was referred to in chinese records as the king of great palola however it is unknown if baltistan was under gilgit rule at the time the chinese emperor also granted the ruler of cashmere chandrāpīḍa tchenfolopili the title of king of cashmere by 721722 baltistan had come under the influence of the tibetan empire in 721–722 the tibetan army attempted but failed to capture gilgit or bruzha yasin valley by this time according to chinese records the king of little palola was mochingmang chinese 沒謹忙 pinyin méijǐnmáng he had visited the tang court requesting military assistance against the tibetans between 723 and 728 the korean buddhist pilgrim hyecho passed through this area in 737738 tibetan troops under the leadership of minister bel kyesang dongtsab of emperor me agtsom took control of little palola by 747 the chinese army under the leadership of the ethnickorean commander gao xianzhi had recaptured little palola great palola was subsequently captured by the chinese army in 753 under military governor feng changqing however by 755 due to the an lushan rebellion the tang chinese forces withdrew and were no longer able to exert influence in central asia or in the regions around gilgitbaltistan the control of the region was left to the tibetan empire they referred to the region as bruzha a toponym that is consistent with the ethnonym burusho used today tibetan control of the region lasted until late800s ce turkic tribes practising zoroastrianism arrived in gilgit during the 7th century and founded the trakhan dynasty in gilgit in the 14th century sufi muslim preachers from persia and central asia introduced islam in baltistan famous amongst them was mir sayyid ali hamadani who came through kashmir while in the gilgit region islam entered in the same century through turkic tarkhan rulers gilgitbaltistan was ruled by many local rulers amongst whom the maqpon dynasty of skardu and the rajas of hunza were famous the maqpons of skardu unified gilgitbaltistan with chitral and ladakh especially in the era of ali sher khan anchan who had friendly relations with the mughal court anchans reign brought prosperity and entertained art sport and variety in architecture he introduced polo to the gilgit region and sent a group of musicians from chitral to delhi to learn indian music mughal architecture influenced the architecture of the region as well under his reign later anchan in his successors abdal khan had great influence though in the popular literature of baltistan where he is still alive as a dark figure by the nickname mizos maneater the last maqpon raja ahmed shah ruled all of baltistan between 1811 and 1840 the areas of gilgit chitral and hunza had already become independent of the maqponscitation needed before the demise of shribadat a group of shina people migrated from gilgit dardistan and settled in the dras and kharmang areas the descendants of those dardic people can be still found today and are believed to have maintained their dardic culture and shina language up to the present timecitation needed in november 1839 dogra commander zorawar singh whose allegiance was to gulab singh started his campaign against baltistan by 1840 he conquered skardu and captured its ruler ahmad shah ahmad shah was then forced to accompany zorawar singh on his raid into western tibet meanwhile baghwan singh was appointed as administrator thanadar in skardu but in the following year ali khan of rondu haidar khan of shigar and daulat ali khan from khaplu led a successful uprising against the dogras in baltistan and captured the dogra commander baghwan singh in skardu in 1842 dogra commander wasir lakhpat with the active support of ali sher khan iii from kartaksho conquered baltistan for the second time there was a violent capture of the fortress of kharphocho haidar khan from shigar one of the leaders of the uprising against the dogras was imprisoned and died in captivity gosaun was appointed as administrator thanadar of baltistan and till 1860 the entire region of gilgitbaltistan was under the sikhs and then the dogras after the defeat of the sikhs in the first anglosikh war the region became a part of the jammu and kashmir princely state which since 1846 had remained under the rule of the dogras the population in gilgit perceived itself as ethnically different from kashmiris and disliked being ruled by the kashmir state the region remained with the princely state with temporary leases of some areas assigned to the british until 1 november 1947 after pakistans independence jammu and kashmir initially remained an independent state later on 22 october 1947 tribal militias backed by pakistan crossed the border into jammu and kashmir after poonch rebellion and jammu muslim massacre hari singh made a plea to india for assistance and signed the instrument of accession making his state a part of india india airlifted troops to defend the kashmir valley and the invaders were pushed back behind uri gilgits population did not favour the states accession to india the muslims of the frontier ilaqas gilgit and the adjoining hill states had wanted to join pakistan sensing their discontent major william brown the maharajas commander of the gilgit scouts mutinied on 1 november 1947 overthrowing the governor ghansara singh the bloodless coup détat was planned by brown to the last detail under the code name datta khel which was also joined by a rebellious section of the jammu and kashmir state forces under mirza hassan khan brown ensured that the treasury was secured and minorities were protected a provisional government aburi hakoomat was established by the gilgit locals with raja shah rais khan as the president and mirza hassan khan as the commanderinchief however major brown had already telegraphed khan abdul qayyum khan asking pakistan to take over pakistans political agent khan mohammad alam khan arrived on 16 november and took over the administration of gilgit brown outmaneuvered the proindependence group and secured the approval of the mirs and rajas for accession to pakistan according to brown alam replied to the locals you are a crowd of fools led astray by a madman i shall not tolerate this nonsense for one instance and when the indian army starts invading you there will be no use screaming to pakistan for help because you wont get it the provisional government faded away after this encounter with alam khan clearly reflecting the flimsy and opportunistic nature of its basis and support the provisional government lasted 16 days according to scholar yaqub khan bangash it lacked sway over the population the gilgit rebellion did not have civilian involvement and was solely the work of military leaders not all of whom had been in favour of joining pakistan at least in the short term historian ahmed hasan dani says that although there had been a lack of public participation in the rebellion propakistan sentiments were intense in the civilian population and their antikashmiri sentiments were also clear according to various scholars the people of gilgit as well as those of chilas koh ghizr ishkoman yasin punial hunza and nagar joined pakistan by choice after taking control of gilgit the gilgit scouts along with azad irregulars moved towards baltistan and ladakh and captured skardu by may 1948 they successfully blocked indian reinforcements sent to relieve skardu and proceeded towards kargil and leh indian forces mounted an offensive in the autumn of 1948 to push them back from ladakh but baltistan came into the rebels territory on 1 january 1948 india took the issue of jammu and kashmir to the united nations security council in april 1948 the council passed a resolution calling for pakistan to withdraw from all of jammu and kashmir and for india to reduce its forces to the minimum level following which a plebiscite would be held to ascertain the peoples wishes however no withdrawal was ever carried out india insisted that pakistan had to withdraw first and pakistan contended there was no guarantee that india would withdraw afterwards gilgitbaltistan along with the western districts that came to be called azad kashmir have remained under the control of pakistan ever since while the residents of gilgitbaltistan expressed a desire to join pakistan after gaining independence from maharaja hari singh pakistan declined to merge the region into itself because of the territorys link to jammu and kashmir for a short period after joining pakistan gilgitbaltistan was governed by azad kashmir if only theoretically but not practically through its claim of being an alternative government for jammu and kashmir in 1949 the government of azad kashmir handed over the administration of gilgitbaltistan to the federal government under the karachi agreement according to indian journalist paul sahni this is seen as an effort by pakistan to legitimise its rule over gilgitbaltistan according to pakistani analyst ershad mahmud there were two reasons why administration was transferred from azad kashmir to pakistan according to the international crisis group the karachi agreement is highly unpopular in gilgitbaltistan because gilgitbaltistan was not a party to it even while it was its own fate was being decided from then until the 1990s gilgitbaltistan was governed through the colonialera frontier crimes regulations which were originally created for the northwest tribal regions they treated tribal people as barbaric and uncivilised levying collective fines and punishments people had no right to legal representation or appeal members of tribes had to obtain prior permission from the police to travel anywhere and had to keep the police informed about their movements there was no democratic setup during this period all political and judicial powers remained in the hands of the ministry of kashmir affairs and northern areas kana the people of gilgitbaltistan were deprived of rights enjoyed by citizens of pakistan and azad kashmir a primary reason for this state of affairs was the remoteness of gilgitbaltistan another factor was that the whole of pakistan itself was deficient in democratic norms and principles therefore the federal government did not prioritise democratic development in the region there was also a lack of public pressure as an active civil society was absent in the region with young educated residents usually opting to live in pakistans urban centers instead of staying in the region in 1970 the two parts of the territory viz the gilgit agency and baltistan were merged into a single administrative unit and given the name northern areasfailed verification the shaksgam tract was ceded by pakistan to china following the signing of the sinopakistani frontier agreement in 1963 in 1969 a northern areas advisory council naac was created later renamed to northern areas council nac in 1974 and northern areas legislative council nalc in 1994 but it was devoid of legislative powers all lawmaking was concentrated in the kana ministry of pakistan in 1994 a legal framework order lfo was created by the kana ministry to serve as the de facto constitution for the region in 1974 the former state subject law was abolished in gilgit baltistan and pakistanis from other areas could buy land and settle in 1984 the territorys importance shot up within pakistan with the opening of the karakoram highway and the regions population became more connected to mainland pakistan the improved connectivity facilitated the local population to avail itself of educational opportunities in the rest of pakistan italso allowed the political parties of pakistan and azad kashmir to set up local branches raise political awareness in the region according to ershad mahmud these pakistani political parties have played a laudable role in organising a movement for democratic rights among the residents of gilgitbaltistan in the 1988 gilgit massacre groups of islamist sunnis supported by osama bin laden pervez musharraf general ziaul haq and mirza aslam beg slaughtered hundreds of local shias in the late 1990s the president of aljihad trust filed a petition in the supreme court of pakistan to determine the legal status of gilgitbaltistan in its judgement of 28 may 1999 the court directed the government of pakistan to ensure the provision of equal rights to the people of gilgitbaltistan and gave it six months to do so following the supreme court decision the government took several steps to devolve power to the local level however in several policy circles the point was raised that the pakistani government was helpless to comply with the court verdict because of the strong political and sectarian divisions in gilgitbaltistan and also because of the territorys historical connection with the still disputed kashmir region and that this prevented the determination of gilgitbaltistans real status a position of deputy chief executive was created to act as the local administrator but the real powers still rested with the chief executive who was the federal minister of kana the secretaries were more powerful than the concerned advisors in the words of one commentator in spite of various reforms packages over the years the situation is essentially unchanged meanwhile public rage in gilgitbaltistan grew alarmingly prominent antagonist groups have mushroomed protesting the absence of civic rights and democracy the pakistani government has debated granting provincial status to gilgitbaltistan\\ngilgitbaltistan has been a member state of the unrepresented nations and peoples organization since 2008\\naccording to antia mato bouzas the pppled pakistani government has attempted a compromise through its 2009 reforms between its traditional stand on the kashmir dispute and the demands of locals most of whom may have propakistan sentiments while the 2009 reforms have added to the selfidentification of the region they have not resolved the constitutional status of the region within pakistan according to 2010 news reports the people of gilgitbaltistan want to merge into pakistan as a separate fifth province however as of 2015 leaders of azad kashmir were opposed to any step towards integrating gilgitbaltistan into pakistan the people of gilgitbaltistan have opposed integration with azad kashmir they desire pakistani citizenship and a constitutional status for their region in 2016 for the first time in the countrys constitution gilgitbaltistan had been mentioned by name in september 2020 it was reported that pakistan decided to elevate gilgitbaltistans status to that of a fullfledged province the territory of presentday gilgitbaltistan became a separate administrative unit in 1970 under the name northern areas it was formed by the amalgamation of the former gilgit agency the baltistan district of the ladakh wazarat and the hill states of hunza and nagar it presently consists of fourteen districts has a population approaching one million and an area of approximately 73000 square kilometres 28000 square miles and shares borders with pakistan china afghanistan and india in 1993 an attempt was made by the high court of azad jammu and kashmir to annex gilgitbaltistan but was quashed by the supreme court of pakistan after protests by the locals of gilgitbaltistan who feared domination by the kashmiris government of pakistan abolished state subject rule in gilgitbaltistan in 1974 which resulted in demographic changes in the territory while administratively controlled by pakistan since the first kashmir war gilgitbaltistan has never been formally integrated into the pakistani state and does not participate in pakistans constitutional political affairs on 29 august 2009 the gilgitbaltistan empowerment and selfgovernance order 2009 was passed by the pakistani cabinet and later signed by the then president of pakistan asif ali zardari the order granted selfrule to the people of gilgitbaltistan by creating among other things an elected gilgitbaltistan legislative assembly and gilgitbaltistan council gilgitbaltistan thus gained a de facto provincelike status without constitutionally becoming part of pakistan currently gilgitbaltistan is neither a province nor a state it has a semiprovincial status traditionally the pakistani government had rejected gilgitbaltistani calls for integration with pakistan on the grounds that it would jeopardise its demands for the whole kashmir issue to be resolved according to un resolutions however since imran khan announced that it would be granted provisional provincial status the pakistani political parties finally agree to pass constitutional amendment to propose gilgitbaltistan as a province some kashmiri nationalist groups such as the jammu and kashmir liberation front claim gilgitbaltistan as part of a future independent state to match what existed in 1947

date back to between 5000 and 1000 bce showing single animals triangular men and hunting scenes in which the animals are larger than the hunters these carvings were pecked into the rock with stone tools and are covered with a thick patina that proves their age the ethnologist karl jettmar\\xa0de has pieced together the history of the area from inscriptions and recorded his findings in rock carvings and inscriptions in the northern areas of pakistan and the laterreleased between gandhara and the silk roads — rock carvings along the karakoram highway many of these carvings and inscriptions will be inundated andor destroyed when the planned bashadiamir dam is built and the karakoram highway is widened the climate of gilgitbaltistan varies from region to region since the

complex history of punjab the boundaries of the region are illdefined and focus on historical accounts and thus the geographical definition of the term punjab has changed over time in the 16th century mughal empire the punjab region was divided into three with the lahore subah in the west the delhi subah in the east and the multan subah in the south in british india until the partition of india in 1947 the punjab province encompassed the presentday indian states and union territories of punjab haryana himachal pradesh chandigarh and delhi and the pakistani regions of punjab and islamabad

referring to the rivers jhelum chenab ravi sutlej and beas all are tributaries of the indus river the sutlej being the largest references to a land of five rivers may be found in the mahabharata which calls one of the regions in ancient bharat panchanada sanskrit पञ्चनद romanized\\xa0pañcanada lit\\u2009five rivers persian place names are very common in northwest india and pakistan the ancient greeks referred to the region as pentapotamía greek πενταποταμία which has the same meaning as the persian word the punjab region is noted as the site of one of the earliest urban societies the indus valley civilization that flourished from about 3000\\xa0bce and declined rapidly 1000 years later following the indoaryan migrations that overran the region in waves between 1500\\xa0bce and 500\\xa0bce frequent intertribal wars stimulated the growth of larger groupings ruled by chieftains and kings who ruled local kingdoms known as mahajanapadas the rise of kingdoms and dynasties in the punjab is chronicled in the ancient hindu epics particularly the mahabharata the epic battles described in the mahabharata are chronicled as being fought in what is now the state of haryana and historic punjab the gandharas kambojas trigartas andhra pauravas bahlikas bactrian settlers of the punjab yaudheyas and others sided with the kauravas in the great battle fought at kurukshetra according to fauja singh and l\\xa0m joshi there is no doubt that the kambojas daradas kaikayas andhra pauravas yaudheyas malavas saindhavas and kurus had jointly contributed to the heroic tradition and composite culture of ancient punjab the earliest known notable local king of this region was known as king porus who fought the famous battle of the hydaspes against alexander the great his kingdom spanned between rivers hydaspes jhelum and acesines chenab strabo had held the territory to contain almost 300 cities he alongside abisares had a hostile relationship with the kingdom of taxila which was ruled by his extended family when the armies of alexander crossed indus in its eastward migration probably in udabhandapura he was greeted by thethen ruler of taxila omphis omphis had hoped to force both porus and abisares into submission leveraging the might of alexanders forces and diplomatic missions were mounted but while abisares accepted the submission porus refused this led alexander to seek for a faceoff with porus thus began the battle of the hydaspes in 326 bc the exact site remains unknown the battle is thought to be resulted in a decisive greek victory however a b bosworth warns against an uncritical reading of greek sources who were obviously exaggerative alexander later founded two cities—nicaea at the site of victory and bucephalous at the battleground in memory of his horse who died soon after the battlec later tetradrachms would be minted depicting alexander on horseback armed with a sarissa and attacking a pair of indians on an elephant porus refused to surrender and wandered about atop an elephant until he was wounded and his force routed when asked by alexander how he wished to be treated porus replied treat me as a king would treat another king despite the apparently onesided results alexander was impressed by porus and chose to not depose him not only was his territory reinstated but also expanded with alexanders forces annexing the territories of glausaes who ruled to the northeast of porus kingdom after alexanders death in 323\\xa0bce perdiccas became the regent of his empire and after perdiccass murder in 321\\xa0bce antipater became the new regent according to diodorus antipater recognized poruss authority over the territories along the indus river however eudemus who had served as alexanders satrap in the punjab region treacherously killed porus chandragupta maurya with the aid of kautilya had established his empire around 320\\xa0bce the early life of chandragupta maurya is not clear kautilya enrolled the young chandragupta in the university at taxila to educate him in the arts sciences logic mathematics warfare and administration megasthenes account as it has survived in greek texts that quote him states that alexander the great and chandragupta met which if true would mean his rule started earlier than 321\\xa0bce as alexander never crossed the beas river so his territory probably lied in punjab regioncitation needed he has also been variously identified with shashigupta who has same etymology as of chandragupta of paropamisadae western punjab on the account of same life events with the help of the small janapadas of punjab he had gone on to conquer much of the north west indian subcontinent he then defeated the nanda rulers in pataliputra to capture the throne chandragupta maurya fought alexanders successor in the east seleucus when the latter invaded in a peace treaty seleucus ceded all territories west of the indus and offered a marriage including a portion of bactria while chandragupta granted seleucus 500 elephantscitation needed the chief of the mauryan military was also always a yaudheyan warrior according to the bijaygadh pillar inscription which states that the yaudheyas elected their own chief who also served as the general for the mauryans the mauryan military was also made up vastly of men from the punjab janapadas chandraguptas rule was very well organised the mauryans had an autocratic and centralised administration system aided by a council of ministers and also a wellestablished espionage system much of chandraguptas success is attributed to chanakya the author of the arthashastra according to buddhist sources chanakya was native of the punjab who resided in taxila much of the mauryan rule had a strong bureaucracy that had regulated tax collection trade and commerce industrial activities mining statistics and data maintenance of public places and upkeep of templescitation needed in the 9th century the hindu shahi dynasty

weakened ultimately ruling the punjab khyber pakhtunkhwa and territories north into the himalayas in the 19th century maharajah ranjit singh established the sikh empire based in the punjab the empire existed from 1799 when ranjit singh captured lahore to 1849 when it was defeated and conquered in the second anglosikh war it was forged on the foundations of the khalsa from a collection of autonomous sikh misls at its peak in the 19th century the empire extended from the khyber pass in the west to western tibet in the east and from mithankot in the south to kashmir in the north it was divided into four provinces lahore in punjab which became the sikh capital multan also in punjab peshawar and kashmir from 1799 to 1849 religiously diverse with an estimated population of 35\\xa0million in 1831 making it the 19th most populous country at the time it was the last major region of the indian subcontinent to be annexed by the british empire the sikh empire ruled the punjab until the british annexed it in 1849 following the first and second anglosikh wars most of the punjabi homeland formed a province of british india though a number of small princely states retained local rulers who recognized british authority the punjab with its rich farmlands became one of the most important colonial assets lahore was a noted center of learning and culture and rawalpindi became an important military installation most punjabis supported the british during world war i providing men and resources to the war effort even though the punjab remained a source of anti colonial activities\\u200a163\\u200a disturbances in the region increased as the war continued at the end of the war high casualty rates heavy taxation inflation and a widespread influenza epidemic disrupted punjabi society in 1919 a british officer ordered his troops to fire on a crowd of demonstrators mostly sikhs in amritsar the jallianwala massacre fueled the indian independence movement nationalists declared the independence of india from lahore in 1930 but were quickly suppressed when the second world war broke out nationalism in british india had already divided into religious movements many sikhs and other minorities supported the hindus who promised a secular multicultural and multireligious society and muslim leaders in lahore passed a resolution to work for a muslim pakistan making the punjab region a center of growing conflict between indian and pakistani nationalists at the end of the war the british granted separate independence to india and pakistan setting off massive

part of india while west punjab 52 became part of pakistan the punjab bore the brunt of the civil unrest following partition with casualties estimated to be in the millions another major consequence of partition was the sudden shift towards religious homogeneity occurred in all districts across punjab owing to the new international border that cut through the province this rapid demographic shift was primarily due to wide scale migration but also caused by largescale religious cleansing riots which were witnessed across the region at the time according to historical demographer tim dyson in the eastern regions of punjab that ultimately became indian punjab following independence districts that were 66 hindu in 1941 became 80 hindu in 1951 those that were 20 sikh became 50 sikh in 1951 conversely in the western regions of punjab that ultimately became pakistani punjab all districts became almost exclusively muslim by 1951 the geographical definition of the term punjab has changed over time in the 16th century mughal empire it referred to a relatively smaller area between the indus and the sutlej rivers at its height in the first half of the 19th century the sikh empire spanned a total of over 200000\\xa0sq\\xa0mi 520000\\xa0km2 the punjab was a region straddling india and the afghan durrani empire the following modernday political divisions made up the historical punjab region during the sikh empire after ranjit singhs death in 1839 the empire was severely weakened by internal divisions and political mismanagement this opportunity was used by the east india company to launch the first and second anglosikh wars the country was finally annexed and dissolved at the end of the second anglosikh war in 1849 into separate princely states and the province of punjab eventually a lieutenant governorship was formed in lahore as a direct representative of the crown\\u200a221 in british india until the partition of india in 1947 the punjab province was geographically a triangular tract of country of which the indus river and its tributary the sutlej formed the two sides up to their confluence the base of the triangle in the north being the lower himalayan range between those two rivers moreover the province as constituted under british rule also included a large tract outside these boundaries along the northern border himalayan ranges divided it from kashmir and tibet on the west it was separated from the northwest frontier province by the indus until it reached the border of dera ghazi khan district which was divided from baluchistan by the sulaiman range to the south lay sindh and rajputana while on the east the rivers jumna and tons separated it from the united provinces in total punjab had an area of approximately 357 000\\xa0km square about the same size as modern day germany being one of the largest provinces of the british raj it encompassed the present day indian states of punjab haryana chandigarh delhi and some parts of himachal pradesh which were merged with punjab by the british for administrative purposes but excluding the former princely states which were later combined into the patiala and east punjab states union and the pakistani regions of the punjab islamabad capital territory and khyber pakhtunkhwa in 1901 the frontier districts beyond the indus were separated from punjab and made into a new province the northwest frontier province subsequently punjab was divided into four natural geographical divisions by colonial officials on the decadal census data\\u200a2\\u200a\\u200a4 the struggle for indian independence witnessed competing and conflicting interests in the punjab the landed elites of the muslim hindu and sikh communities had loyally collaborated with the british since annexation supported the unionist party and were hostile to the congress party–led independence movement amongst the peasantry and urban middle classes the hindus were the most active national congress supporters the sikhs flocked to the akali movement whilst the muslims eventually supported the muslim league since the partition of the subcontinent had been decided special meetings of the western and eastern section of the legislative assembly were held on 23 june 1947 to decide whether or not the province of the punjab be partitioned after voting on both sides partition was decided and the existing punjab legislative assembly was also divided into west punjab legislative assembly and the east punjab legislative assembly this last assembly before independence held its last sitting on 4 july 1947 historically lahore has been the capital of the punjab region and continues to be the most populous city in the region with a population of 11 million for the city proper faisalabad is the 2nd most populous city and largest industrial hub in this region other major cities are rawalpindi gujranwala multan ludhiana amritsar jalandhar and chandigarh are the other cities in punjab with a cityproper population of over a million the climate has significant impact on the economy of punjab particularly for agriculture in the region climate is not uniform over the whole region as the areas adjacent to the himalayas generally receive heavier rainfall than those at a distance there are three main seasons and two transitional periods during the hot season from midapril to the end of june the temperature may reach 49\\xa0°c 120\\xa0°f the monsoon season from july to september is a period of heavy rainfall providing water for crops in addition to the supply from canals and irrigation systems the transitional period after the monsoon season is cool and mild leading to the winter season when the temperature in january falls to 5\\xa0°c 41\\xa0°f at night and 12\\xa0°c 54\\xa0°f by day during the transitional period from winter to the hot season sudden hailstorms and heavy showers may occur causing damage to crops the major language is punjabi which is written in india with the gurmukhi script and in pakistan using the shahmukhi script the punjabi language has official status and is widely used in education and administration in indian punjab whereas in pakistani punjab these roles are instead fulfilled by the urdu language several languages closely related to punjabi are spoken in the periphery of the region dogri kangri and other western pahari dialects are spoken in the northcentral and northeastern peripheries of the region while bagri is spoken in southcentral and southeastern sections meanwhile saraiki is generally spoken across a wide belt covering the southwest while in the northwest there are large pockets containing speakers of hindko and pothwari the punjabi people first practiced hinduism the oldest recorded religion in the punjab region the historical vedic religion constituted the religious ideas and practices in the punjab during the vedic period 1500–500\\xa0bce centered primarily in the worship of indra the bulk of the rigveda was composed in the punjab region between circa 1500 and 1200 bc while later vedic scriptures were composed more eastwards between the yamuna and ganges rivers an ancient indian law book called the manusmriti developed by brahmin hindu priests shaped punjabi religious life from 200 bc onward later the spread of buddhisim and jainism in the indian subcontinent saw the growth of buddhism and jainism in the punjab islam was introduced via southern punjab in the 8th century becoming the majority by the 16th century via local conversion there was a small jain community left in punjab by the 16th century while the buddhist community had largely disappeared by the turn of the 10th century the region became predominantly muslim due to missionary sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of the punjab region the rise of sikhism in the 1700s saw some punjabis both hindu and muslim accepting the new sikh faith a number of punjabis during the colonial period of india became christians with all of these religions characterizing the religious diversity now found in the punjab region a number of punjabis during the colonial period of india became christians with all of these religions characterizing the religious diversity now found in the punjab region additionally during the colonial era the practice of religious syncretism among punjabi muslims and punjabi hindus was noted and documented by officials in census reports in other parts of the province too traces of hindu festivals are noticeable among the muhammadans in the western punjab baisakhi the new years day of the hindus is celebrated as an agricultural festival by all muhammadans by racing bullocks yoked to the well gear with the beat of tomtoms and large crowds gather to witness the show the race is called baisakhi and is a favourite pastime in the wellirrigated tracts then the processions of tazias in muharram with the accompaniment of tomtoms fencing parties and bands playing on flutes and other musical instruments which is disapproved by the orthodox muhammadans and the establishment of sabils shelters where water and sharbat are served out are clearly influenced by similar practices at hindu festivals while the illuminations on occasions like the chiraghan fair of shalamar lahore are no doubt practices answering to the holidaymaking instinct of the converted hindus\\u200a174\\u200abesides actual conversion islam has had a considerable influence on the hindu religion the sects of reformers based on a revolt from the orthodoxy of varnashrama dharma were obviously the outcome of the knowledge that a different religion could produce equally pious and right thinking men laxity in social restrictions also appeared simultaneously in various degrees and certain customs were assimilated to those of the muhammadans on the other hand the miraculous powers of muhammadan saints were enough to attract the saint worshiping hindus to allegiance if not to a total change of faith the shamsis are believers in shah shamas tabrez of multan and follow the imam for the time being of the ismailia sect of shias they belong mostly to the sunar caste and their connection with the sect is kept a secret like freemasonry they pass as ordinary hindus but their devotion to the imam is very strong\\u200a130 territory comprises the contemporary subdivisions of

centuries throughout the everchanging extent of their empire in the indian subcontinent it developed from the architectural styles of earlier muslim dynasties in india and from iranian and central asian architectural traditions particularly timurid architecture it also further incorporated and syncretized influences from wider indian architecture especially during the reign of akbar r 1556–1605 mughal buildings have a uniform pattern of structure and character including large bulbous domes slender minarets at the corners massive halls large vaulted gateways and delicate ornamentation examples of the style can be found in modernday afghanistan bangladesh india and pakistan the mughal dynasty was established after the victory of babur at panipat in 1526 during his fiveyear reign babur took considerable interest in erecting buildings though few have survived his grandson akbar built widely and the style developed vigorously during his reign among his accomplishments were agra fort the fortcity of fatehpur sikri and the buland darwaza akbars son jahangir commissioned the shalimar gardens in kashmir mughal architecture reached its zenith during the reign of shah jahan who constructed taj mahal the jama masjid of delhi the shalimar gardens of lahore and renovated the lahore fort highranking officials below the emperor were also able to build major monuments as with the example of the wazir khan mosque the last of the great mughal architects was aurangzeb who built the badshahi mosque bibi ka maqbara moti masjid etc mughal emperors and elites consciously used architecture as a way to publicly display their presence and power the extensive architectural patronage of the mughals was made possible by their considerable wealth which exceeded that of other contemporary muslim empires like the ottomans and safavids in the indian subcontinent more monuments survive from the mughal period than any other period major monuments of this time include mosques mausoleums palaces gardens and fortresses mughal architecture was derived from three main architectural traditions local indoislamic architecture the architecture of islamic persia and central asia and indigenous hindu architecture because earlier indoislamic architecture already borrowed from both hindu and islamic architectural styles certain influences in mughal architecture can be difficult to attribute to one source or the other with regards to hindu architecture local rajput palaces were likely a key influence early mughal architecture developed from existing indoislamic architecture while following the model of timurid architecture based in central asia due in part to the timurid ancestry of the mughal dynastys founder babur by the late 16th century a more distinctive mughal tradition emerged based on the combination of these two sources under the reign of akbar r\\u20091556–1605 the use of hindu architectural elements was especially prolific including in highprofile construction projects like fatehpur sikri under his successors there was a shift towards more typically islamic architectural designs under akbar in particular nonmuslims were present among the highestranking officials and were able to become patrons of architecture as well the most notable example is raja man singh a hindu amir who built both hindu temples and muslim mosques and shrines during the reign of shah jahan r\\u20091628–1658 a classical mughal style was consolidated and remained essentially in use until the end of the mughal period a certain level of stylistic consistency was achieved throughout the empire at this period thanks to the role of a central department of architects similar to the imperial architects that existed in the ottoman empire mughal architecture has also influenced later indian architectural styles including the indosaracenic style of the british raj the rajput style and the sikh stylecitation needed mughal architecture is distinguished by an elegant style in which careful linear divisions of spaces and surfaces took priority over the more threedimensional combination of elements that distinguished earlier indoislamic architecture the use of colour was also relatively restrained with emphasis instead on finishing surfaces with highquality polished materials bulbous domes and ogive arches were among the most prominent recurring elements in addition to domes and arches the local tradition of trabeate construction also continued especially in secular architecture like palaces another distinguishing characteristic was the use of red sandstone as a building material along with white marble this replaced the prominence of brick in earlier indoislamic architecture though construction materials still varied depending on the region sandstone is a very hard material but local indian stonemasons were skilled in carving it with intricate detail which was another distinguishing feature of the mughal style white marble was initially used as a cladding to compliment and finish the look of sandstone buildings as in humayuns tomb but later it was used on a grander scale to cover entire buildings as in the taj mahal brick was sometimes still used for domes and arches but in these cases it was usually faced with plaster or stone as a finish decorative motifs included geometric and floral designs as well as elaborate inscriptions in arabic persian and even in local languages during the late mughal period decoration was commonly executed in tile or stone tilework was more commonly applied to the exterior of buildings and existed in two main types cuerda seca and mosaic tilework cuerda seca tiles were decorated with coloured glazes separated by dark lines while mosaic tilework consisted of singlecoloured tile pieces that were cut and fitted together to create larger patterns stonework was of high quality and marks one of the most sophisticated aspects of mughal decoration carved stonework included ornatelysculpted pillars and corbels flat panels carved in low relief with depictions of flowers  and pierced marble screens known as jalis pietra dura known as parchin kari in the indian subcontinent was the technique of decorating with inlaid stone it developed in this region independently from the italian technique that is widely known elsewhere elements of earlier indoislamic architecture that continued in mughal architecture are the cusped multifoil arches which appeared earlier in the architecture of delhi and gujarat as well as the dochala roof a feature originating in bengali architecture that was adopted in the architecture of the bengal sultanate features of persian or central asian timurid influence were the iwan a vaulted space open to one side the use of domes the pointed fourcentred arch the use of decorative tilework and the chahar bagh type of garden along with various other motifs and building layouts in dome construction persianstyle squinches were used in some cases but in other cases the domes were supported by flat beams over the corners of the chamber elements of mughal architecture that demonstrate hindu influences include the use of trabeate constructions the use of corbel arches instead of arches with voussoirs and the style of ornatelycarved pillars jharokhas projecting balconies chhatris domed kiosks and chhajjas wide stone eaves are also elements that were borrowed from local hindu architecture and became very popular in mughal architecture some elements such as projecting balconies had parallels in islamic architecture elsewhere but their specific mughal forms were of local inspiration large fortified citadels or palace complexes such as the agra fort and the red fort in delhi were enclosed in massive walls reinforced by semicircular towers and entered via monumental gateways inside the classic mughal palace was laid out with symmetrical gardens and various pavilions open pavilions with rows of cusped arches were a recurring feature rich decoration was used to embellish rooms and halls gardens were a favourite concern of mughal emperors whether they were created as separate dedicated garden sites or as the setting for pavilions and mausoleums within larger architectural complexes they were laid out in a formal manner with terraces precise divisions and water features mosques were relatively more restrained in their decoration but were built on a grand scale the typical mosque layout in the classic mughal era involved a large rectangular courtyard surrounded by an arcade on three sides and a prayer hall on one side the prayer hall consisted of a wide vaulted hall fronted by an arcade of monumental arches with the central archway consisting of a larger iwan rising above the others the most monumental and elaborate mughal structures were royal mausoleums deliberately designed to show off the power and sophistication of their patrons the classic mughal tomb was an octagonal or rectangular structure with a central dome and outer iwans raised on a terraced platform other public buildings and infrastructure works included roads milestones known as kos minar caravanserais inns for merchants and travelers and bridges these were more functional in nature and less decorative though some caravanserais were embellished with elaborate gateways the architectural patronage of babur the first mughal emperor is mainly known for its terraced gardens these gardens often established in palaces and citadels were modeled on the persian chahar bagh four gardens type in which gardens are geometrically divided into different plots usually four equal parts this type followed timurid antecedents though the use of water channels as linear dividers may have been a mughal innovation babur himself was initially buried at agra but in 1644 his tomb was moved to one of his favourite gardens in kabul now known as the gardens of babur in religious architecture baburs mosques also followed the designs of earlier timurid mosques with  a tall central entrance portal pishtaq a courtyard and a prayer hall covered by a large central dome flanked by side aisles covered by smaller domes an example of this is his mosque at panipat agra fort is a unesco world heritage site in agra uttar pradesh the major part of agra fort was built by akbar from 1565 to 1574 the architecture of the fort clearly indicates the free adoption of the rajput planning and construction some of the important buildings in the fort are jahangiri mahal built for jahangir and his family the moti masjid and mena bazaars the jahangiri mahal has a courtyard surrounded by doublestoreyed halls and rooms humayuns tomb is the tomb of the mughal emperor humayun in delhi india the tomb was commissioned by humayuns first wife and chief consort empress bega begum also known as haji begum in 1569–70 and designed by mirak mirza ghiyas and his son sayyid muhammad persian architects chosen by her it was the first gardentomb on the indian subcontinent it is often regarded as the first mature example of mughal architecture akbars greatest architectural achievement was the construction of fatehpur sikri his capital city near agra at a trade and jain pilgrimages  the construction of the walled city was started in 1569 and completed in 1574 it contained some of the most beautiful buildings – both religious and secular which testify to the emperors aim of achieving social political and religious integration  the main religious buildings were the huge jama masjid and small tomb of salim chisti buland darwaza also known as the gate of magnificence was built by akbar in 1576 to commemorate his victory over gujarat and the deccan it is 40 metres high and 50 metres from the ground the total height of the structure is about 54 metres from ground level the haramsara the royal seraglio in fatehpur sikri was an area where the royal women lived the opening to the haramsara is from the khwabgah side

names of god the mosque would later influence construction of the larger wazir khan mosque a few decades later the tomb of itimāduddaulah is a mausoleum in the city of agra in the indian state of uttar pradesh often described as a jewel box sometimes called the bachcha taj as the tomb of itimāduddaulah is often regarded as a draft of the taj mahal rather than building huge monuments like his predecessors to demonstrate their power shah jahan built elegant monuments the force and originality of this previous building style gave way under shah jahan to a delicate elegance and refinement of detail illustrated in the palaces erected during his reign at agra delhi and lahore some examples include the taj mahal at agra the tomb of his wife mumtaz mahal under the chief architect ustad ahmad lahori a punjabi muslim the moti masjid pearl mosque in the agra fort and the jama masjid at delhi the latter built under the supervision of his grand vizier saadullah khan a punjabi muslim are

it is now one of pakistans most iconic sights the sixth mughal emperor aurangzeb chose lahore as the site for his new mosque aurangzeb unlike the previous emperors was not a major patron of art and architecture and instead focused during much of his reign on various military conquests which added to the mughal realm the mosque was built to commemorate aurangzebs military campaigns in southern india in particular against the maratha emperor shivaji as a symbol of the mosques importance it was built directly across from the lahore fort and its alamgiri gate which was concurrently built by aurangzeb during construction of the mosque the mosque was commissioned in 1671 with construction overseen by the emperors foster brother and governor of lahore muzaffar hussein  also known by the name fidai khan koka after only two years of construction the mosque was opened in 1673 on 7 july 1799 the sikh army of ranjit singh took control of lahore after the capture of the city maharaja ranjit singh used its vast courtyard as a stable for his army horses and its 80 hujras small study rooms surrounding the courtyard as quarters for his soldiers and as magazines for military stores in 1818 he built a marble edifice in the hazuri bagh facing the mosque known as the hazuri bagh baradari which he used as his official royal court of audience marble slabs for the baradari may have been plundered by the sikhs from other monuments in lahore in 1839 after his death construction of a samadhi in his memory was begun by his son and successor kharak singh at a site adjacent to the mosque during the first anglosikh war in 1841 ranjit singhs son sher singh used the mosques large minarets for placement of zamburahs or light guns which were used to bombard the supporters of chand kaur who had taken refuge in the besieged lahore fort in one of these bombardments the forts diwaneaam hall of public audience was destroyed but was subsequently rebuilt in the british era during this time henri de la rouche a french cavalry officer employed in the army of sher singh also used a tunnel connecting the badshahi mosque to the lahore fort to temporarily store gunpowder in 1849 the british seized control of lahore from the sikh empire during the british raj the mosque and the adjoining fort continued to be used as a military garrison the 80 cells built into the walls surrounding its vast courtyard were demolished by the british after the indian rebellion of 1857 so as to prevent them from being used for antibritish activities the cells were replaced by open arcades known as dalans because of increasing muslim resentment against the use of the mosque as a military garrison the british set up the badshahi mosque authority in 1852 to oversee the restoration and to reestablish it as a place of religious worship from then onwards piecemeal repairs were carried out under the supervision of the badshahi mosque authority the building was officially handed back to the muslim community by john lawrence who was the viceroy of india the building was then reestablished as a mosque in april 1919 after the amritsar massacre a mixed sikh hindu and muslim crowd of an estimated 2500035000 gathered in the mosques courtyard in protest a speech by gandhi was read at the event by khalifa shujauddin who would later become speaker of the provincial assembly of the punjab

credited for extensive restorations to the mosque he was buried adjacent to the mosque in the hazuri bagh restoration works begun in 1939 continued after the independence of pakistan and were completed in 1960 at a total cost of 48 million rupees on the occasion of the 2nd islamic summit held at lahore on 22 february 1974 thirtynine heads of muslim states offered their friday prayers in the badshahi mosque including among others zulfiqar ali bhutto of pakistan faisal of saudi arabia muammar gaddafi yasser arafat and sabah iii alsalim alsabah of kuwait \\nin 1993 the badshahi mosque

courtyard was initiated using red sandstone imported from the original mughal source near jaipur in the indian state of rajasthan as a gateway to the west and persia in particular lahore had a strong regional style which was heavily influenced by persian architectural styles earlier mosques such as the wazir khan mosque were adorned in intricate kashi kari or kashan style tile work from which the badshahi mosque would depart aurangzeb chose an architectural plan similar to that of shah jahans choice for the jama masjid in delhi though he built the badshahi mosque on a much larger scalecitation needed both mosques feature red sandstone with white marble inlay which is a departure from typical mosque design in lahore in which decoration is done by means of intricate tile work entrance to the mosque complex is via a twostorey edifice built of red sandstone which is beautifully and elaborately decorated with framed and carved paneling on ea of its facades the edifice features a muqarna an

afghanistan it ruled approximately threequarters of the country from 1996 to 2001 before being overthrown following the american invasion it recaptured kabul on 15 august 2021 following the departure of most coalition forces after nearly 20 years of insurgency and currently controls all of the country however its government is not recognized by any country the taliban government has been criticized for restricting human rights in afghanistan including the right of women and girls to work and to have an education the taliban emerged in september 1994 as one of the prominent factions in the afghan civil war and largely consisted of students ṭālib from the pashtun areas of eastern and southern afghanistan who had been educated in traditional islamic schools madāris under the leadership of mullah omar r\\u20091996–2001 the movement spread throughout most of afghanistan shifting power away from the mujahideen warlords in 1996 the group administered roughly threequarters of the country and established the first islamic emirate of afghanistan the talibans government was opposed by the northern alliance militia which seized parts of northeast afghanistan and largely maintained international recognition as a continuation of the interim islamic state of afghanistan the taliban held control of most of the country until being overthrown after the united states invasion of afghanistan in december 2001 many members of the taliban fled to neighboring pakistan after being overthrown the taliban launched an insurgency to fight the usbacked islamic republic of afghanistan and the natoled international security assistance force isaf in the war in afghanistan in may 2002 exiled members formed the council of leaders rahbarī shūrā based in the city of quetta in pakistan under hibatullah akhundzadas leadership in may 2021 the taliban launched a military offensive that culminated in the fall of kabul on 15 august 2021 and the taliban regaining control of

were widely condemned for massacres against afghan civilians harsh discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities denial of un food supplies to starving civilians destruction of cultural monuments banning women from school and most employment and prohibition of most music following their return to power in 2021 the afghanistan government budget lost 80 of its funding and food insecurity became widespread the taliban returned afghanistan to many policies implemented under its previous rule including banning women from holding almost any jobs requiring women to wear headtotoe coverings such as the burqa blocking women from travelling without male guardians and banning all education for girls the word taliban is pashto طالبان ṭālibān meaning students the plural of ṭālib this is a loanword from arabic طالب ṭālib using the pashto plural ending ān ان in arabic طالبان ṭālibān means not students but rather two students as it is a dual form the arabic plural being طلاب ṭullāb—occasionally causing some confusion to arabic speakers since becoming a loanword in english taliban besides a plural noun referring to the group has also been used as a singular noun referring to an individual for example john walker lindh has been referred to as an american taliban rather than an american talib in domestic media this is different in afghanistan where a member or a supporter of the group is referred to as a talib طالب or its plural talibha طالبها in other definitions taliban means seekers in english the spelling taliban has gained predominance over the spelling taleban in american english the definite article is used the group is referred to as the taliban rather than taliban in englishlanguage media in pakistan the definite article is always omitted both pakistani and indian englishlanguage media tend to name the group afghan taliban thus distinguishing it from the pakistani taliban additionally in pakistan the word talibans is often used when referring to more than one taliban member in afghanistan the taliban is frequently called the گروه طالبان gorohe taleban dari term which means taliban group as per daripersian grammar there is no the prefix meanwhile in pashto a determiner is normally used and as a result the group is normally referred to as per pashto grammar د طالبان da taliban or د طالبانو da talibano after the soviet union intervened and occupied afghanistan in 1979 islamic mujahideen fighters waged a war against soviet forces during the soviet–afghan war nearly all of the talibans original leaders had fought for either the hezbi islami khalis or the harakati inqilabe islami factions of the mujahideen pakistans president muhammad ziaulhaq feared that the soviets were also planning to invade balochistan pakistan so he sent akhtar abdur rahman to saudi arabia to garner support for the afghan resistance against soviet occupation forces a while later the us cia and the saudi arabian general intelligence directorate gid funnelled funding and equipment through the pakistani interservice intelligence agency isi to the afghan mujahideen about 90000 afghans including mohammed omar were trained by pakistans isi during the 1980s in april 1992 after the fall of the sovietbacked régime of mohammad najibullah many afghan political parties agreed on a peace and powersharing agreement the peshawar accord which created the islamic state of afghanistan and appointed an interim government for a transitional period gulbuddin hekmatyars hezbe islami gulbuddin hezbe wahdat and ittihadi islami did not participate the

operational financial and military support from pakistans isi with that help hekmatyars forces were able to destroy half of kabul iran assisted the hezbe wahdat forces of abdulali mazari saudi arabia supported the ittihadi islami faction the conflict between these militias also escalated into war due to this sudden initiation of civil war working government departments police units or a system of justice and accountability for the newly created islamic state of afghanistan did not have time to formcitation needed atrocities were committed by individuals inside different factionscitation needed ceasefires negotiated by representatives of the islamic states newly appointed defense minister ahmad shah massoud president sibghatullah mojaddedi and later president burhanuddin rabbani the interim government or officials from the international committee of the red cross icrc commonly collapsed within days the countryside in northern afghanistan parts of which were under the control of defense minister massoud remained calm and some reconstruction took place the city of herat under the rule of islamic state ally ismail khan also witnessed relative calmcitation needed meanwhile southern afghanistan was neither under the control of foreignbacked militias nor the government in kabul but was ruled by local leaders such as gul agha sherzai and their militias the taliban are a movement of religious students talib from the pashtun areas of eastern and southern afghanistan who were educated in traditional islamic schools there were also tajik and uzbek students demarking them from the more ethniccentric mujahideen groups which played a key role in the talibans rapid growth and success in september 1994 mullah mohammad omar and 50 students founded the group in his hometown of kandahar\\nsince 1992 omar had been studying in the sangihisar madrassa in maiwand northern kandahar province he was unhappy because islamic law had not been installed in afghanistan after the ousting of communist rule and now he and his group pledged to rid afghanistan of warlords and criminals many of the students involved in the formation of taliban were former commanders in the afghansoviet war within months 15000 students in pakistan mostly afghan refugees who were studying in religious schools or madrasas or as one source calls them jamiat ulemaeislamrun madrasas joined the group in an effort to aid the antisoviet insurgency and inculcate a hatred of foreign invaders in afghan children the us government covertly distributed schoolbooks which promoted militant islamic teachings and included images of weapons and soldiers the taliban used the american textbooks but they scratched out the images of human faces which were contained in them in keeping with their strict aniconistic and fundamentalist interpretation of islam the united states agency for international development gave millions of dollars to the university of nebraska at omaha in the 1980s and the university used the money to fund the writing and the publishing of the textbooks in local languages the early taliban were motivated by the suffering of the afghan people which they believed was being caused by the power struggles which were being waged by rival afghan groups which were not adhering to the moral code of islam in their religious schools they had been taught to believe that they should strictly adhere to islamic law the government of pakistan has repeatedly denied that it provides any military assistance to the taliban in its diplomacy but the sources state that pakistan was heavily involved already in october 1994 in creating of the taliban pakistans interservices intelligence agency isi strongly supporting the taliban in 1994 hoped for a new ruling power in afghanistan favourable to pakistan even if the taliban received financial support from pakistan in 1995 and 1996 and even if pakistani support was forthcoming from an early stage of the taliban movements existence the connection was fragile and statements from both the pakistani isi as well as the taliban early on demonstrated the uneasy nature of the relationship the isi and pakistan aimed to exert control while the taliban leadership manoeuvred between keeping its independence and sustaining support the main supporters in pakistan were general naseerullah babar who mainly thought in terms of geopolitics opening trade routes to central asia and maulana fazlurrehman of the jamiat ulemaeislam f as the group represented deobandism and aimed to counter the influence of the jama’ate islami and growing wahhabism on 3 november 1994 the taliban in a surprise attack conquered kandahar city before 4 january 1995 they controlled 12 afghan provinces militias controlling the different areas often surrendered without a fight omars commanders were a mixture of former smallunit military commanders and madrassa teachers at these stages the taliban were popular because they stamped out corruption curbed lawlessness and made the roads and area safe in a bid to establish their rule over all afghanistan the taliban expanded from their kandahar base sweeping large territories in early 1995 the movement moved towards kabul but they suffered a devastating defeat by government forces of the islamic state of afghanistan under the command of ahmad shah massoud while retreating from kabul taliban fighters started shelling the city killing many civilians the media reported in march 1995 that following the talibans shelling they lost much respect from afghans and were seen as just another powerhungry militia after a series of setbacks the taliban managed to take control of the western city of herat on 5 september 1995 following allegations by the recognised government that pakistan was aiding the taliban a large mob of people attacked the pakistani embassy in kabul the day after on 26 september 1996 as the taliban prepared for another major offensive massoud ordered a full retreat from kabul to continue antitaliban resistance in the northeastern hindu kush mountains instead of engaging in street battles in kabul the taliban entered kabul on 27 september 1996 and established the islamic emirate of afghanistan analysts described the taliban then as developing into a proxy force for pakistans regional interests the military goal of the taliban during the period 1995 to 2001 was to return the order of abdur rahman the iron emir by the reestablishment of a state with pashtun dominance within the northern areas the taliban sought to establish an islamic government through law and order alongside a strict interpretation of sharia law in accordance with the hanafi school of islamic jurisprudence and the religious edicts of mullah omar upon the entire land of afghanistan by 1998 the talibans emirate controlled 90 of afghanistan in december 2000 the unsc in resolution 1333 recognising humanitarian needs of the afghan people condemning the use of taliban territory for training of terrorists and taliban providing safe haven to osama bin laden issued severe sanctions against afghanistan under taliban control\\nin october 2001 the united states with allies including the afghan northern alliance invaded afghanistan and routed the taliban régime the taliban leadership fled to pakistan when the taliban took power in 1996 twenty years of continuous warfare had devastated afghanistans infrastructure and economy there was no running water little electricity few telephones functioning roads or regular energy supplies basic necessities like water food housing and others were in desperately short supply in addition the clan and family structure that provided afghans with a socialeconomic safety net was also badly damaged afghanistans infant mortality was the highest in the world a full quarter of all children died before they reached their fifth birthday a rate several times higher than most other developing countries international charitable andor development organisations nongovernmental organisations or ngos were extremely important to the supply of food employment reconstruction and other services but the taliban proved highly suspicious towards the help those organisations offered see § united nations and ngos with over a million deaths throughout the years of war the number of families headed by widows had reached 98000 by 1998 in kabul where vast portions of the city had been devastated by rocket attacks more than half of its 12\\xa0million people benefited in some way from ngo activities even for drinking water the civil war and its neverending refugee stream continued throughout the talibans reign the mazar herat and shomali valley offensives displaced more than threequarters of a million civilians using scorched earth tactics to prevent them from supplying the enemy with aid the historical buddhas of bamiyan were destroyed on omar mujahids orders taliban decisionmakers particularly mullah omar seldom if ever talked directly to nonmuslim foreigners so aid providers had to deal with intermediaries whose approvals and agreements were often reversed around september 1997 the heads of three un agencies in kandahar were expelled from the country after protesting when a female attorney for the un high commissioner for refugees was forced to talk from behind a curtain so her face would not be visible when the un increased the number of muslim women staff to satisfy taliban demands the taliban then required all female muslim un staff travelling to afghanistan to be chaperoned by a mahram or a blood relative in july 1998 the taliban closed all ngo offices in kabul by force after those organisations refused to move to a bombedout former polytechnic college as ordered one month later the un offices were also shut down as food prices rose and conditions deteriorated planning minister qari din mohammed explained the talibans indifference to the loss of humanitarian aid we muslims believe god the almighty will feed everybody one way or another if the foreign ngos leave then it is their decision we have not expelled them the few organisations active in kandahar were not subjected to the same demands and continued their operations the taliban were largely founded by pakistans interservices intelligence beginning in 1994 the isi used the taliban to establish a régime in afghanistan which would be favourable to pakistan as they were trying to gain strategic depth since the creation of the taliban the isi and the pakistani military have given financial logistical and military support according to pakistani afghanistan expert ahmed rashid between 1994 and 1999 an estimated 80000 to 100000 pakistanis trained and fought in afghanistan on the side of the taliban peter tomsen stated that up until 911 pakistani military and isi officers along with thousands of regular pakistani armed forces personnel had been involved in the fighting in afghanistan during 2001 according to several international sources 28000–30000 pakistani nationals 14000–15000 afghan taliban and 2000–3000 alqaeda militants were fighting against antitaliban forces in afghanistan as a roughly 45000 strong military force pakistani president pervez musharraf – then as chief of army staff – was responsible for sending thousands of pakistanis to fight alongside the taliban and bin laden against the forces of ahmad shah massoud of the estimated 28000 pakistani nationals fighting in afghanistan 8000 were militants recruited in madrassas filling regular taliban ranks the document further states that the parents of those pakistani nationals know nothing regarding their childs military involvement with the taliban until their bodies are brought back to pakistan a 1998 document by the us state department confirms that 20–40 percent of regular taliban soldiers are pakistani according to the state department report and reports by human rights watch the other pakistani nationals fighting in afghanistan were regular pakistani soldiers especially from the frontier corps but also from the army providing direct combat support human rights watch wrote in 2000 of all the foreign powers involved in efforts to sustain and manipulate the ongoing fighting in afghanistan pakistan is distinguished both by the sweep of its objectives and the scale of its efforts which include soliciting funding for the taliban bankrolling taliban operations providing diplomatic support as the talibans virtual emissaries abroad arranging training for taliban fighters recruiting skilled and unskilled manpower to serve in taliban armies planning and directing offensives providing and facilitating shipments of ammunition and fuel and  directly providing combat support on 1 august 1997 the taliban launched an attack on sheberghan the main military base of abdul rashid dostum dostum has said the reason the attack was successful was due to 1500 pakistani commandos taking part and that the pakistani air force also gave support in 1998 iran accused pakistan of sending its air force to bomb mazarisharif in support of taliban forces and directly accused pakistani troops for war crimes at bamiyan the same year russia said pakistan was responsible for the military expansion of the taliban in northern afghanistan by sending large numbers of pakistani troops some of whom had subsequently been taken as prisoners by the antitaliban united front during 2000 the un security council imposed an arms embargo against military support to the taliban with un officials explicitly singling out pakistan the un secretarygeneral implicitly criticized pakistan for its military support and the security council stated it was deeply distressed over reports of involvement in the fighting on the taliban side of thousands of nonafghan nationals in july 2001 several countries including the united states accused pakistan of being in violation of un sanctions because of its military aid to the taliban the taliban also obtained financial resources from pakistan in 1997 alone after the capture of kabul by the taliban pakistan gave 30\\xa0million in aid and a further 10\\xa0million for government wages during 2000 mi6 reported that the isi was taking an active role in several alqaeda training camps the isi helped with the construction of training camps for both the taliban and alqaeda from 1996 to 2001 the alqaeda of osama bin laden and ayman alzawahiri became a state within the taliban state bin laden sent arab and central asian alqaeda militants to join the fight against the united front among them his brigade 055 the role of the pakistani military has been described by international observers as well as by the antitaliban leader ahmad shah massoud as a creeping invasion in late 1996 ahmad shah massoud and abdul rashid dostum former enemies created the united front northern alliance against the taliban that were preparing offensives against the remaining areas under the control of massoud and those under the control of dostum the united front included beside the dominantly tajik forces of massoud and the uzbek forces of dostum hazara troops led by haji mohammad mohaqiq and pashtun forces under the leadership of commanders such as abdul haq and haji abdul qadir notable politicians and diplomats of the united front included abdul rahim ghafoorzai abdullah abdullah and massoud khalili from the taliban conquest of kabul in september 1996 until november 2001 the united front controlled roughly 30 of afghanistans population in provinces such as badakhshan kapisa takhar and parts of parwan kunar nuristan laghman samangan kunduz ghōr and bamyan after longstanding battles especially for the northern city of mazarisharif abdul rashid dostum and his junbish forces were defeated by the taliban and their allies in 1998 dostum subsequently went into exile ahmad shah massoud remained the only major antitaliban leader inside afghanistan who was able to defend vast parts of his territory against the taliban in the areas under his control massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the womens rights declaration in the area of massoud women and girls did not have to wear the afghan burqa they were allowed to work and to go to school in at least two known instances massoud personally intervened against cases of forced marriage it is our conviction and we believe that both men and women are created by the almighty both have equal rights women can pursue an education women can pursue a career and women can play a role in society – just like men massoud is adamant that in afghanistan women have suffered oppression for generations he says that the cultural environment of the country suffocates women but the taliban exacerbate this with oppression  his most ambitious project is to shatter this cultural prejudice and so give more space freedom and equality to women – they would have the same rights as men afghan traditions would need a generation or more to overcome and could only be challenged by education he said humayun tandar who took part as an afghan diplomat in the 2001 international conference on afghanistan in bonn said that strictures of language ethnicity region were also stifling for massoud that is why  he wanted to create a unity which could surpass the situation in which we found ourselves and still find ourselves to this day this applied also to strictures of religion jeanjosé puig describes how massoud often led prayers before a meal or at times asked his fellow muslims to lead the prayer but also did not hesitate to ask a christian friend jeanjosé puig or the jewish princeton university professor michael barry jeanjosé we believe in the same god please tell us the prayer before lunch or dinner in your own language human rights watch cites no human rights crimes for the forces under direct control of massoud for the period from october 1996 until the assassination of massoud in september 2001 400000 to one million afghans fled from the taliban to the area of massoud national geographic concluded in its documentary inside the taliban the only thing standing in the way of future taliban massacres is ahmad shah massoud the taliban repeatedly offered massoud a position of power to make him stop his resistance massoud declined he explained in one interview the taliban say come and accept the post of prime minister and be with us and they would keep the highest office in the country the presidentship – but at what cost the difference between us concerns mainly our way of thinking about the very principles of the society and the state we can not accept their conditions of compromise or else we would have to give up the principles of modern democracy we are fundamentally against the system called the emirate of afghanistan the united front in its proposals for peace demanded the taliban to join a political process leading towards nationwide democratic elections in early 2001 massoud employed a new strategy of local military pressure and global political appeals resentment was increasingly gathering against taliban rule from the bottom of afghan society including the pashtun areas massoud publicised their cause of popular consensus general elections and democracy worldwide at the same time he was very wary not to revive the failed kabul government of the early 1990s already in 1999 he started the training of police forces which he trained specifically in order to keep order and protect the civilian population in case the united front would be successful massoud stated the taliban are not a force to be considered invincible they are distanced from the people now they are weaker than in the past there is only the assistance given by pakistan osama bin laden and other extremist groups that keep the taliban on their feet with a halt to that assistance it is extremely difficult to survive from 1999 onwards a renewed process was set into motion by the tajik ahmad shah massoud and the pashtun abdul haq to unite all the ethnicities of afghanistan while massoud united the tajiks hazara and uzbeks as well as some pashtun commanders under his united front command the famed pashtun commander abdul haq received increasing numbers of defecting pashtun taliban as taliban popularity trended downward both agreed to work together with the exiled afghan king zahir shah international officials who met with representatives of the new alliance which pulitzer prize winner steve coll referred to as the grand pashtuntajik alliance said its crazy that you have this today  pashtuns tajiks uzbeks hazara  they were all ready to buy in to the process  to work under the kings banner for an ethnically balanced afghanistan senior diplomat and afghanistan expert peter tomsen wrote the lion of kabul abdul haq and the lion of panjshir ahmad shah massoud  haq massoud and karzai afghanistans three leading moderates could transcend the pashtun–nonpashtun north–south divide the most senior hazara and uzbek leader were also part of the process in late 2000 massoud officially brought together this new alliance in a meeting in northern afghanistan to discuss among other things a loya jirga or a traditional council of elders to settle political turmoil in afghanistan that part of the pashtun–tajik–hazara–uzbek peace plan did eventually materialise an account of the meeting by author and journalist sebastian junger says in 2000 when i was there  i happened to be there in a very interesting time  massoud brought together afghan leaders from all ethnic groups they flew from london paris the usa all parts of afghanistan pakistan india he brought them all into the northern area where he was he held a council of  prominent afghans from all over the world brought there to discuss the afghan government after the taliban  we met all these men and interviewed them briefly one was hamid karzai i did not have any idea who he would end up being in early 2001 ahmad shah massoud with ethnic leaders from all of afghanistan addressed the european parliament in brussels asking the international community to provide humanitarian help to the people of afghanistan he stated that the taliban and alqaeda had introduced a very wrong perception of islam and that without the support of pakistan and bin laden the taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year on this visit to europe he also warned that his intelligence had gathered information about a largescale attack on us soil being imminent the president of the european parliament nicole fontaine called him the pole of liberty in afghanistan on 9 september 2001 massoud then aged 48 was the target of a suicide attack by two arabs posing as journalists at khwaja bahauddin in the takhar province of afghanistan massoud who had survived countless assassination attempts over a period of 26 years died in a helicopter taking him to a hospital the first attempt on massouds life had been carried out by hekmatyar and two pakistani isi agents in 1975 when massoud was only 22 years old in early 2001 alqaeda wouldbe assassins were captured by massouds forces while trying to enter his territory the funeral though in a rather rural area was attended by hundreds of thousands of mourning people the assassination of massoud is believed to have a connection to the september 11 attacks on us soil which killed nearly 3000 people and which appeared to be the terrorist attack that massoud had warned against in his speech to the european parliament several months earlier john p oneill was a counterterrorism expert and the assistant director of the fbi until late 2001 he retired from the fbi and was offered the position of director of security at the world trade center wtc he took the job at the wtc two weeks before 911 on 10 september 2001 oneill told two of his friends were due and were due for something big  some things have happened in afghanistan referring to the assassination of massoud i dont like the way things are lining up in afghanistan  i sense a shift and i think things are going to happen  soon oneill died on 11 september 2001 when the south tower collapsed after 911 massouds united front troops and united front troops of abdul rashid dostum who returned from exile ousted the taliban from power in kabul with american air support in operation enduring freedom from october to december 2001 the united front gained control of much of the country and played a crucial role in establishing the posttaliban interim government under hamid karzai on 20 september 2001 us president george w bush speaking to a joint session of congress tentatively blamed alqaeda for the 11 september attacks stating that the leadership of al qaeda had great influence in afghanistan and supported the taliban régime in controlling most of that country bush said we condemn the taliban régime and went on to state tonight the united states of america makes the following demands on the taliban which he said were not open to negotiation or discussion the us petitioned the international community to back a military campaign to overthrow the taliban the un issued two resolutions on terrorism after the 11 september attacks the resolutions called on all states to increase cooperation and full implementation of the relevant international conventions relating to terrorism and specified consensus recommendations for all countries according to a research briefing by the house of commons library although the united nations security council unsc did not authorise the usled military campaign it was widely although not universally perceived to be a legitimate form of selfdefense under the un charter and the council moved quickly to authorize a military operation to stabilize the country in the wake of the invasion moreover on 12 september 2001 nato approved a campaign against afghanistan as selfdefense against armed attack the taliban ambassador to pakistan abdul salem zaeef responded to the ultimatum by demanding convincing evidence that bin laden was involved in the attacks stating our position is that if america has evidence and proof they should produce it additionally the taliban insisted that any trial of bin laden be held in an afghan court zaeef also claimed that 4000 jews working in the trade center had prior knowledge of the suicide missions and were absent on that day this response was generally dismissed as a delaying tactic rather than a sincere attempt to cooperate with the ultimatum\\ncheck quotation syntax\\non 22 september the united arab emirates and later saudi arabia withdrew recognition of the taliban as afghanistans legal government leaving neighbouring pakistan as the only remaining country with diplomatic ties on 4 october the taliban agreed to turn bin laden over to pakistan for trial in an international tribunal that operated according to islamic sharia law but pakistan blocked the offer as it was not possible to guarantee his safety on 7 october the taliban ambassador to pakistan offered to detain bin laden and try him under islamic law if the us made a formal request and presented the taliban with evidence a bush administration official speaking on condition of anonymity rejected the taliban offer and stated that the us would not negotiate their demands on 7 october 2001 less than one month after the 11 september attacks the us aided by the united kingdom canada and other countries including several from the nato alliance initiated military action bombing taliban and alqaedarelated camps the stated intent of military operations was to remove the taliban from power and prevent terrorists from using afghanistan as a base of operationscitation needed the cias elite special activities division sad units were the first us forces to enter afghanistan many different countries intelligence agencies were on the ground or they were already operating within the theatre before the sad units arrived because technically the sad units are composed of civilian paramilitaries rather than military forces they joined the afghan united front northern alliance in order to prepare for the subsequent arrival of us special operations forces the united front northern alliance and sad and special forces combined to overthrow the taliban with minimal coalition casualties and without the use of international conventional ground forces the washington post stated in an editorial by john lehman in 2006 what made the afghan campaign a landmark in the us militarys history is that it was prosecuted by special operations forces from all the services along with navy and air force tactical power operations by the afghan northern alliance and the cia were equally important and fully integrated no large army or marine force was employed on 14 october the taliban offered to discuss handing over osama bin laden to a neutral country in return for a bombing halt but only if the taliban were given evidence of bin ladens involvement the us rejected this offer and continued military operations mazarisharif fell to united front troops of ustad atta mohammad noor and abdul rashid dostum on 9 november triggering a cascade of provinces falling with minimal resistance in november 2001 before the capture of kunduz by united front troops under the command of mohammad daud daud thousands of top commanders and regular fighters of the taliban and alqaeda pakistani interservices intelligence agents and military personnel and other volunteers and sympathizers in the kunduz airlift were evacuated and airlifted out of kunduz by pakistan army cargo aircraft to pakistan air force air bases in chitral and gilgit in pakistans northern areas this was dubbed the airlift of evil by us military forces around kunduz and subsequently used as a term in media reports on the night of 12 november the taliban retreated south from kabul on 15 november they released eight western aid workers after three months in captivity by 13 november the taliban had withdrawn from both kabul and jalalabad finally in early december the taliban gave up kandahar their last stronghold dispersing without surrenderingcitation needed the united states has conducted targeted killings against taliban leaders mainly using special forces and sometimes unmanned aerial vehicles british forces also used similar tactics mostly in helmand province afghanistan during operation herrick british special forces carried out targeted killings against at least fifty high and local taliban commanders in helmand provincecitation needed the taliban have also used targeted killings in 2011 alone they killed notable antitaliban leaders such as former afghan president burhanuddin rabbani the police chief in northern afghanistan the commander of the elite antitaliban 303 pamir corps mohammad daud daud and the police chief of kunduz abdul rahman saidkhaili all of them belonged to the massoud faction of the united front according to guantanamo bay charge sheets the united states department of defense believes the taliban may maintain a 40man undercover unit called jihad kandahar which is used for undercover operations including targeted killings pakistan has been accused of continuing to support the taliban after the september 11 attacks on the united states an allegation pakistan denies in mid2002 exiled taliban leaders in pakistan began reconnecting with each other they formed the quetta shura in the pakistani city of quetta with the fall of kabul to antitaliban forces in november 2001 isi forces worked with and helped taliban militias who were in full retreat taliban alqaeda combatants and isi operatives were evacuated from kunduz on pakistan army cargo aircraft to pakistan air force bases in pakistans northern areas former pakistani president pervez musharraf wrote in his memoirs that richard armitage the former us deputy secretary of state said pakistan would be bombed back to the stoneage if it continued to support the taliban although armitage has since denied using the stone age phrase pashtun tribal chief hamid karzai was elected as the national interim leader and the taliban had surrendered kandahar following an offer of amnesty by karzai however the us rejected a part of the amnesty in which taliban leader mullah omar could live in dignity in his native kandahar the taliban were not invited to the bonn agreement of december 2001 which many cite as the cause of the talibans battlefield resurgence and the continuation of conflict this was partly due to the talibans apparent defeat but also a us condition that the taliban would not be allowed to participate by 2003 the taliban showed signs of a comeback and not long afterwards their insurgency was underway un negotiator lakhdar brahimi admitted in 2006 that not inviting the taliban to bonn was our original sin in may and june 2003 high taliban officials proclaimed the taliban regrouped and ready for guerrilla war to expel us forces from afghanistan in late 2004 the thenhidden mullah omar announced an insurgency against america and its puppets ie transitional afghan government forces to regain the sovereignty of our country on 29 may 2006 while – according to american website the spokesmanreview – afghanistan faced a mounting threat from armed taliban fighters in the countryside a us military truck of a convoy in kabul lost control and plowed into twelve civilian vehicles killing one and injuring six people the surrounding crowd got angry and a riot arose lasting all day and resulting in 20 dead and 160 injured when stonethrowing and gunfire had come from a crowd of some 400 men the us troops had used their weapons to defend themselves while leaving the scene a us military spokesman said a correspondent for the financial times in kabul suggested that this was the outbreak of a ground swell of resentment and growing hostility to foreigners that had been growing and building since 2004 and may also have been triggered by a us air strike a week earlier in southern afghanistan killing 30 civilians where she assumed that the taliban had been sheltering in civilian houses the continued support from tribal and other groups in pakistan the drug trade and the small number of nato forces combined with the long history of resistance and isolation indicated that taliban forces and leaders were surviving suicide attacks and other terrorist methods not used in 2001 became more common observers suggested that poppy eradication which hurt the livelihoods of those afghans who had resorted to their production and civilian deaths caused by airstrikes abetted the resurgence these observers maintained that policy should focus on hearts and minds and on economic reconstruction which could profit from switching from interdicting to diverting poppy production to make medicine other commentators viewed islamabads shift from war to diplomacy as an effort to appease growing discontent because of the talibans leadership structure mullah dadullahs assassination in may 2007 did not have a significant effect other than to damage incipient relations with pakistan negotiations had long been advocated by thenafghan president hamid karzai as well as reportedly the british and pakistani governments but resisted by the american government karzai offered peace talks with the taliban in september 2007 but this was swiftly rejected by the insurgent group citing the presence of foreign troops on 8 february 2009 us commander of operations in afghanistan general stanley mcchrystal and other officials said that the taliban leadership was in quetta pakistan\\nby 2009 a strong insurgency had coalesced known as operation al faath the arabic word for victory taken from the koran in the form of a guerrilla war the pashtun tribal group with over 40\\xa0million members including afghans and pakistanis had a long history of resistance to occupation forces so the taliban may have comprised only a part of the insurgency most postinvasion taliban fighters were new recruits mostly drawn from local madrasas in december 2009 asia times online reported that the taliban had offered to give the us legal guarantees that it would not allow afghanistan to be used for attacks on other countries and that the us had given no response as of july 2016 the us time magazine estimated 20 of afghanistan to be under taliban control with southernmost helmand province as their stronghold while us and international resolute support coalition commander general nicholson in december 2016 likewise stated that 10 was in taliban hands while another 26 of afghanistan was contested between the afghan government and various insurgency groups on 7 august 2015 the taliban killed about 50 people in kabul in august 2017 reacting to a hostile speech by us president trump a taliban spokesman retorted that they would keep fighting to free afghanistan of american invaders in january 2018 a taliban suicide bomber killed over 100 people in kabul using a bomb in an ambulance by 2020 after the islamic state of iraq and the levant isil had lost almost all of its conquered territory and committed fewer terrorist acts the global think tank called the institute for economics  peace considered the taliban to have overtaken isil as the most dangerous terrorist group in the world due to their recent campaigns for territorial expansion on 29 may 2020 it was reported that mullah omars son mullah yaqoob was now acting as leader of the taliban after numerous quetta shura members were infected with covid19 it was previously confirmed on 7 may 2020 that yaqoob had become head of the taliban military commission making him the insurgents military chief among those infected in the quetta shura which continued to hold inperson meetings were hibatullah akhundzada and sirajuddin haqqani then commanders of the taliban and haqqani network respectively the talibans cofounder and thensecondincommand abdul ghani baradar was one of the leading taliban members who favored talks with the us and afghan governments karzais administration reportedly held talks with baradar in february 2010 however later that month baradar was captured in a joint uspakistani raid in the city of karachi in pakistan the arrest infuriated karzai and invoked suspicions that he was seized because the pakistani intelligence community was opposed to afghan peace talks karzai declared after his reelection in the 2009 afghan presidential election that he would host a peace jirga in kabul in an effort for peace the event attended by 1600 delegates took place in june 2010 however the taliban and the hezbi islami gulbuddin who were both invited by karzai as a gesture of goodwill did not attend the conference a mindset change and strategy occurred within the obama administration in 2010 to allow possible political negotiations to solve the war the taliban themselves had refused to speak to the afghan government portraying them as an american puppet sporadic efforts for peace talks between the us and the taliban occurred afterward and it was reported in october 2010 that taliban leadership commanders the quetta shura had left their haven in pakistan and been safely escorted to kabul by nato aircraft for talks with the assurance that nato staff would not apprehend them after those talks concluded it emerged that the leader of this taliban delegation who claimed to be akhtar mansour the secondincommand of the taliban was actually an imposter who had duped nato officials karzai confirmed in june 2011 that secret talks were taking place between the us and the taliban but these collapsed by january 2012 further attempts to resume talks were canceled in march 2012 and june 2013 following a dispute between the afghan government and the taliban regarding the latters opening of a political office in qatar president karzai accused the taliban of portraying themselves as a government in exile in july 2015 pakistan hosted the first official peace talks between taliban representatives and the afghan government us and china attended the talks brokered by pakistan in murree as two observers in january 2016 pakistan hosted a round of fourway talks with afghan chinese and american officials but the taliban did not attend the taliban did hold informal talks with the afghan government in 2016 on 27 february 2018 following an increase in violence afghan president ashraf ghani proposed unconditional peace talks with the taliban offering them recognition as a legal political party and the release of the taliban prisoners the offer was the most favorable to the taliban since the war started it was preceded by months of national consensus building which found that afghans overwhelmingly supported a negotiated end to the war two days earlier the taliban had called for talks with the us saying it must now be established by america and her allies that the afghan issue cannot be solved militarily america must henceforth focus on a peaceful strategy for afghanistan instead of war us president donald trump twice accused pakistan of harboring the taliban and of inaction against terrorists first in august 2017 then again in january 2018 on 29 february 2020 the us–taliban deal officially titled agreement for bringing peace to afghanistan was signed in doha qatar the provisions of the deal included the withdrawal of all american and nato troops from afghanistan a taliban pledge to prevent alqaeda from operating in areas under taliban control and talks between the taliban and the afghan government akhundzada purportedly hailed the doha accords as a victory despite the peace agreement between the us and the taliban insurgent attacks against afghan security forces were reported to have surged in the country in the 45 days after the agreement between 1 march and 15 april 2020 the taliban conducted more than 4500 attacks in afghanistan which showed an increase of more than 70 as compared to the same period in the previous year talks between the afghan government and the taliban began in doha on 12 september 2020 the negotiations were set for march but have been delayed over a prisoner exchange dispute mawlavi abdul hakim led the initial negotiations for the taliban abdullah abdullah was one of the leading figures for the afghan republics negotiating team the afghan government team also comprised womens rights activists in mid 2021 the taliban led a major offensive in afghanistan during the withdrawal of us troops from the country which gave them control of over half of afghanistans 421 districts as of 23 july 2021 by midaugust 2021 the taliban controlled every major city in afghanistan following the near seizure of the capital kabul the taliban occupied the presidential palace after the incumbent president ashraf ghani fled afghanistan to the united arab emirates ghanis asylum was confirmed by the uae ministry of foreign affairs and international cooperation on 18 august 2021 remaining afghan forces under the leadership of amrullah saleh ahmad massoud and bismillah khan mohammadi retreated to panjshir to continue resistance the taliban had seized power from an established government backed by some of the worlds bestequipped militaries and as an ideological insurgent movement dedicated to bringing about a truly islamic state its victory has been compared to that of the  chinese communist revolution in the 1940s or iranian revolution of 1979 with their sweeping remake of society however as of 2021–2022 senior taliban leaders  have emphasized the softness of their revolution and how they desired good relations with the united states in discussions with american journalist jon lee anderson anderson notes that the talibans war against any graven images so vigorous in their early rule has been abandoned perhaps made impossible by smartphones and instagram one local observer sayed hamid gailani has argued the taliban have not killed a lot of people after returning to power women are seen out on the street zabihullah mujahid acting deputy minister of information and culture noted there are still women working in a number of government ministries and claimed that girls will be allowed to attend secondary education when bank funds are unfrozen and the government can fund separate spaces and transportation for them when asked about the slaughter of hazara shia by the first taliban régime suhail shaheen the taliban nominee for ambassador to the un told anderson the hazara shia for us are also muslim we believe we are one like flowers in a garden in late 2021 journalists from the new york times embedded with a sixman taliban unit tasked with protecting the shiite sakhi shrine in kabul from the islamic state noting how seriously the men appeared to take their assignment the units commander said that we do not care which ethnic group we serve our goal is to serve and provide security for afghans in response to international criticism over lack of diversity an ethnic hazara was appointed deputy health minister and an ethnic tajik appointed deputy trade minister on the other hand the ministry of womens affairs has been closed and its  building is the new home of ministry for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice according to anderson some women still employed by the government are being forced to sign in at their jobs and then go home to create the illusion of equity and the appointment of ethnic minorities has been dismissed by an adviser to the taliban as tokenism reports have circulated of hazara farmers being forced from their land by ethnic pashtuns of raids of activists homes and of extrajudicial executions of former government soldiers and intelligence agents according to a human rights watchs report released in november 2021 the taliban killed or forcibly disappeared more than 100 former members of the afghan security forces in the three months since the takeover in just the four provinces of ghazni helmand kandahar and kunduz according to the report the taliban identified targets for arrest and execution through intelligence operations and access to employment records that were left behind former members of the security forces were also killed by the taliban within days of registering with them to receive a letter guaranteeing their safety despite taliban claims that the isis has been defeated is carried out suicide bombings in october 2021 at shia mosques in kunduz and kandahar killing over 115 people as of late 2021 there were still sticky bomb explosions every few days in the capital kabul explanations for the relative moderation of the new taliban government and statements from its officials such as – we have started a new page we do not want to be entangled with the past –include that it did not expect to take over the country so quickly and still had problems to work out among their factions  that 7 billion in afghan government funds in us banks has been frozen and that the 80 of the previous governments budget that came from the united states its partners or international lenders has been shut off creating  serious economic crisis according to the un world food program country director mary ellen mcgroarty as of late 2021 early 2022 228 million afghans are already severely food insecure and seven million of them are one step away from famine and that the world community  has unanimously asked the taliban to form an inclusive government ensure the rights of women and minorities and guarantee that afghanistan will no more serve as the launching pad for global terrorist operations before it recognizes the taliban government  in conversation with journalist anderson senior taliban leaders implied that the harsh application of sharia during their first era of rule in the 1990s was necessary because of the depravity and chaos that remained from the  soviet occupation but that now  mercy and compassion were the order of the day this was contradicted by former senior members of the ministry of womens affairs one of which who told anderson they will do anything to convince the international community to give them financing but eventually ill be forced to wear the burqa again they are just waiting after taliban retook power in 2021 border clashes erupted between the taliban with its neighbors includes iran and pakistan leading to casualties on both sides in the early months of taliban rule international journalists have had some access to afghanistan in february 2022 several international journalists including andrew north were detained the committee to protect journalists described their detention as a sad reflection of the overall decline of press freedom and increasing attacks on journalists under taliban rule the journalists were released after several days subsequently watchdog organizations have continued to document a number of arrests of local journalists as well as barring access to international journalists in september 2021 the government ordered primary schools to reopen for both sexes and announced plans to reopen secondary schools for male students without committing to do the same for female students while the taliban stated that female college students will be able to resume higher education provided that they are segregated from male students and professors when possible the guardian noted that if the high schools do not reopen for girls the commitments to allow university education would become meaningless once the current cohort of students graduated higher education minister abdul baqi haqqani said that female university students will be required to observe proper hijab but did not specify if this required covering the face kabul university reopened in february 2022 with female students attending in the morning and males in the afternoon other than the closure of the music department few changes to the curriculum were reported female students were officially required to wear an abaya and a hijab to attend although some wore a shawl instead attendance was reportedly low on the first day in march 2022 the taliban abruptly halted plans to allow girls to resume secondary school education even when separated from males at the time the washington post reported that apart from university students sixth is now the highest grade girls may attend the afghan ministry of education cited the lack of an acceptable design for female student uniforms on december 20 2022 in violation of their prior promises the taliban banned female students from attending higher education institutions with immediate effect the following day december 21 2022 the taliban instituted a ban on all education for all girls and women around the country alongside a ban on female staff in schools including teaching professions teaching was one of the last few remaining professions open to women the talibans ideology has been described as combining an innovative form of sharia islamic law which is based on deobandi fundamentalism and militant islamism combined with pashtun social and cultural norms which are known as pashtunwali because most taliban are pashtun tribesmen political militant islam portal the talibans ideology has been described as an innovative form of sharia combining pashtun tribal codes or pashtunwali with radical deobandi interpretations of islam favoured by jamiat ulemaeislam and its splinter groups their ideology was a departure from the islamism of the antisoviet mujahideen rulersclarification needed and the radical islamistsclarification needed inspired by the sayyid qutb ikhwan the taliban have said they aim to restore peace and security to afghanistan including western troops leaving and to enforce sharia or islamic law once in power according to journalist ahmed rashid at least in the first years of their rule the taliban adopted deobandi and islamist antinationalist beliefs and they opposed tribal and feudal structures removing traditional tribal or feudal leaders from leadership roles the taliban strictly enforced their ideology in major cities like herat kabul and kandahar but in rural areas the taliban had little direct control and as a result they promoted village jirgas so in rural areas they did not enforce their ideology as stringently as they enforced it in cities the talibans religiouspolitical philosophy especially during its first régime from 1996 to 2001 was heavily advised and influenced by grand mufti rashid ahmed ludhianvi and his works its operating political and religious principles since its founding however was modelled on those of abul ala maududi and the jamaateislami movement the taliban being largely pashtun tribesmen frequently follow a preislamic cultural tribal code which is focused on preserving honour pashtunwali strongly influences decisions in regards to other social matters it is best described as subconscious social values and attitudes which promote various qualities such as bravery preserving honour being hospitable to all guests seeking revenge and justice if one has been wronged and providing sanctuary to anyone who seeks refuge even if it is an enemy however nonpashtuns and others usually criticize some of the values such as the pashtun practice of equally dividing inheritances among sons even though the quran clearly states that women are supposed to receive onehalf of a mans share according to ali a jalali and lester grau the taliban received extensive support from pashtuns across the country who thought that the movement might restore their national dominance even pashtun intellectuals in the west who differed with the taliban on many issues expressed support for the movement on purely ethnic grounds written works published by the groups commission of cultural affairs including islami adalat de mujahid toorah\\xa0–  de jihad shari misalay and guidance to the mujahideen outlined the core of the taliban islamic movements philosophy regarding jihad sharia organization and conduct the taliban régime interpreted the sharia law in accordance with the hanafi school of islamic jurisprudence and the religious edicts of mullah omar the taliban mullah omar in particular emphasised dreams as a means of revelation the taliban forbade the consumption of pork and alcohol the use of many types of consumer technology such as music with instrumental accompaniments television filming and the internet as well as most forms of art such as paintings or photography participation in sports including football and chess recreational activities such as kiteflying and the keeping of pigeons and other pets were also forbidden and the birds were killed according to the talibans rules movie theatres were closed and repurposed as mosques the celebration of the western and iranian new years was also forbidden taking photographs and displaying pictures and portraits were also forbidden because the taliban considered them forms of idolatry this extended even to blacking out illustrations on packages of baby soap in shops and painting over roadcrossing signs for livestock women were banned from working girls were forbidden to attend schools or universities were required to observe purdah physical separation of the sexes and awrah concealing the body with clothing and to be accompanied by male relatives outside their households those who violated these restrictions were punished men were forbidden to shave their beards and they were also required to let them grow and keep them long according to the talibans rules and they were also required to wear turbans outside their households prayer was made compulsory and those men who did not respect the religious obligation after the azaan were arrested gambling was banned and the taliban punished thieves by amputating their hands or feet in 2000 the talibans leader mullah omar officially banned opium cultivation and drug trafficking in afghanistan the taliban succeeded in nearly eradicating the majority of the opium production 99 by 2001 during the talibans governance of afghanistan drug users and dealers were both severely persecuted in 1999 mullah omar issued a decree in which he called for the protection of the buddha statues at bamyan two 6thcentury monumental statues of standing buddhas which were carved into the side of a cliff in the bamyan valley in the hazarajat region of central afghanistan but in march 2001 the taliban destroyed the statues following a decree by mullah omar which stated all the statues around afghanistan must be destroyed yahya massoud brother of the antitaliban and resistance leader ahmad shah massoud recalls the following incident after the destruction of the buddha statues at bamyan it was the spring of 2001 i was in afghanistans panjshir valley together with my brother ahmad shah massoud the leader of the afghan resistance against the taliban and bismillah khan who currently serves as afghanistans interior minister one of our commanders commandant momin wanted us to see 30 taliban fighters who had been taken hostage after a gun battle my brother agreed to meet them\\ni remember that his first question concerned the centuriesold buddha statues that were dynamited by the taliban in march of that year shortly before our encounter two taliban combatants from kandahar confidently responded that worshiping anything outside of islam was unacceptable and that therefore these statues had to be destroyed my brother looked at them and said this time in pashto there are still many sun worshippers in this country will you also try to get rid of the sun and drop darkness over the earth the afghan custom of bacha bazi a form of pederastic sexual slavery and pedophilia which is traditionally practiced in various provinces of afghanistan was also forbidden under the sixyear rule of the taliban régime under the rule of the islamic emirate of afghanistan bacha bazi a form of child sexual abuse between older men and young adolescent dancing boys has carried the death penalty the practice remained illegal during the islamic republic of afghanistans rule but the laws were seldom enforced against powerful offenders and police had reportedly been complicit in related crimes a controversy arose during the islamic republic of afghanistans rule after allegations surfaced that us government forces in afghanistan after the invasion of the country deliberately ignored bacha bazi the us military responded by claiming the abuse was largely the responsibility of the local afghan government the taliban has criticized the us role in the abuse of afghan children unlike other islamic fundamentalist organizations the taliban are not salafists although wealthy arab nations had brought salafist madrasas to afghanistan during the soviet war in the 1980s the talibans strict deobandi leadership suppressed the salafi movement in afghanistan after it first came to power in the 1990s following the 2001 us invasion the taliban and salafists joined forces in order to wage a common war against nato forces but salafists were relegated to small groups which were under the talibans command the taliban are averse to debating doctrine with other muslims and did not allow even muslim reporters to question their edicts or to discuss interpretations of the quran following the taliban victory a nationwide campaign was launched against influential salafi factions suspected of past ties to the iskp the taliban closed most salafi mosques and seminaries in 16 provinces including nangarhar and detained clerics it said supported the islamic state during the period of the first taliban rule 1996 to 2001 the taliban attempted to sway shias particularly hazaras to their side making deals with a number of shia political figures as well as securing the support of some shia religious scholars one of these was ustad muhammad akbari a shia hazara politician who separated from abdulali mazaris islamic unity party to form the national islamic unity party thereafter politically aligning himself and his group which gained the support of the majority of islamic unity party members in the hazara hinterland with the taliban another significant shia political figure in the administration of the first islamic emirate was sayed gardizi a sayed hazara from gardiz who was appointed as the wuluswal district governor of yakawlang district being the only shia to hold the position of district governor during the period of the first islamic emirate of afghanistan at the same time however certain incidents caused distrust between the taliban and afghan shias the 1998 mazarisharif massacre was the most significant having taken place in response to ethnic uzbek warlord abdurrashid dustums betrayal and subsequent massacre of taliban fighters as well as false rumors that hazaras had beheaded senior taliban leader mawlawi ihsanullah ihsan at the grave of abdulali mazari which led to the massacre of a significant number of hazaras the commander responsible for the massacre abdulmanan niazi later became notable for his opposition to the talibans leadership having formed the rebellious high council of the islamic emirate of afghanistan in 2015 before being killed by the taliban themselves the desire of the taliban leadership to expand the groups relations with afghan shias continued after the american invasion of afghanistan and the groups return to insurgency some time following the american invasion of iraq in 2003 the taliban published a message to the mujahid people of iraq and afghanistan by mullah omar in which he condemned sectarianism whilst jointly addressing the people of iraq and afghanistan saying its incumbent upon all muslims to thwart all the cursed plots of the cunning enemy and to not give him the opportunity to light the fires of disagreement amongst the muslims a major component of american policy is to categorize the muslims in iraq with the labels of shī’ah and sunnī and in afghanistan with the labels of pashtun tājīk hazārah and uzbek in order to decrease the severity and strength of the popular uprisings and the accompanying armed resistance … as such i request the brothers in iraq to put behind them the differences that exist in the name of shī’ah and sunnī and to fight in unity against the occupying enemy for victory is not possible without unity multiple hazara shia taliban commanders took part in the taliban insurgency primarily from bamyan and daikundi provinces among the qarabaghi tribe of shia hazaras a number of fighters voluntarily joined the taliban due to their close relations with the nearby talibansupporting sunni pashtun population additionally a progovernment shia hazara militia from gizab district of daikundi province called fedayi defected and pledged allegiance to the taliban a few years prior to 2016 with a reported size of 50 fighters in reaction to the 2011 afghanistan ashura bombings which targeted shia afghans in kabul and mazarisharif the taliban published sectarian killings a dangerous enemy conspiracy by taliban official abdulqahhar balkhi in which he stated in afghanistan sunnis and shias have coexisted for centuries they live communal lives and participate in their mutual festivities and for centuries they have fought shoulder to shoulder against foreign invaders  the majority of shia populations in bamyan daikundi and hazarajat have actively aided and continue to support the mujahideen against the foreigners and their puppets the foreign occupiers seek to ignite the flames of communal hatred and violence between sunnis and shias in afghanistan  the followers of islam will only ever reclaim their rightful place in this world if they forgo their petty differences and unite as a single egalitarian body in recent years the taliban have once again attempted to court shiites appointing a shia cleric as a regional governor and recruiting hazaras to fight against iskp in order to distance themselves from their past reputation and improve their relations with the shialed government of iran after the 2021 taliban offensive which led to the restoration of the islamic emirate senior taliban officials including deputy prime minister abdussalam hanafi and foreign minister amirkhan muttaqi have stressed the importance of unity between shiites and sunnis in afghanistan and promised to protect the shiite community the ministry of virtue and vice have also agreed to hire shia ulama in order to implement the ministrys religious edicts in general the taliban has maintained peace with most muslims in the shiite community although the 2022 balkhab uprising resulted in the deaths of some hazaras the talibans ideology is not static before its capture of kabul members of the taliban talked about stepping aside once a government of good muslims took power and once law and order were restored the decisionmaking process of the taliban in kandahar was modelled on the pashtun tribal council jirga together with what was believed to be the early islamic model discussion was followed by the building of a consensus by the believers as the talibans power grew mullah omar made decisions without consulting the jirga or visiting other parts of the country he visited the capital kabul only twice while he was in power taliban spokesman mullah wakil explained decisions are based on the advice of the amirul momineen for us consultation is not necessary we believe that this is in line with the sharia we abide by the amirs view even if he alone takes this view there will not be a head of state instead there will be an amir almuminin mullah omar will be the highest authority and the government will not be able to implement any decision to which he does not agree general elections are incompatible with sharia and therefore we reject them another sign that the talibans ideology was evolving was mullah omars 1999 decree in which he called for the protection of the buddha statues at bamyan and the destruction of them in 2001 the author ahmed rashid suggests that the devastation and hardship which resulted from the soviet invasion and the period which followed it influenced the talibans ideology it is said that the taliban did not include scholars who were learned in islamic law and history the refugee students brought up in a totally male society not only had no education in mathematics science history or geography but also had no traditional skills of farming herding or handicraftmaking nor even knowledge of their tribal and clan lineages in such an environment war meant employment peace meant unemployment dominating women simply affirmed manhood for their leadership rigid fundamentalism was a matter not only of principle but also of political survival taliban leaders repeatedly told rashid that if they gave women greater freedom or a chance to go to school they would lose the support of their rank and file the taliban have been criticized for their strictness towards those who disobeyed their imposed rules and mullah omar has been criticized for titling himself amir almuminin mullah omar was criticized for calling himself amir almuminin on the grounds that he lacked scholarly learning tribal pedigree or connections to the prophets family sanction for the title traditionally required the support of all of the countrys ulema whereas only some 1200 pashtun talibansupporting mullahs had declared that omar was the amir according to ahmed rashid no afghan had adopted the title since 1834 when king dost mohammed khan assumed the title before he declared jihad against the sikh kingdom in peshawar but dost mohammed was fighting foreigners while omar had declared jihad against other afghans another criticism was that the taliban called their 20 tax on truckloads of opium zakat which is traditionally limited to 25 of the zakatpayers disposable income or wealth the taliban have been compared to the 7thcentury kharijites who developed extreme doctrines which set them apart from both mainstream sunni and shiʿa muslims the kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to takfir whereby they declared that other muslims were unbelievers and deemed them worthy of death in particular the taliban have been accused of takfir towards shia after the august 1998 slaughter of 8000 mostly shia hazara noncombatants in mazarisharif mullah abdul manan niazi the taliban commander of the attack and the new governor of mazar who was later killed by the taliban after forming the rebellious high council of the islamic emirate declared from mazars central mosque last year you rebelled against us and killed us from all your homes you shot at us now we are here to deal with you the hazaras are not muslims and now have to kill hazaras you either accept to be muslims or leave afghanistan wherever you go we will catch you if you go up we will pull you down by your feet if you hide below we will pull you up by your hair carter malkasian in one of the first comprehensive historical works on the afghan war argues that the taliban are oversimplified in most portrayals while malkasian thinks that oppressive remains the best word to describe them he points out that the taliban managed to do what multiple governments and political players failed to bring order and unity to the ungovernable land the taliban curbed the atrocities and excesses of the warlord period of the civil war from 1992–1996 malkasian further argues that the talibans imposing of islamic ideals upon the afghan tribal system was innovative and a key reason for their success and durability given that traditional sources of authority had been shown to be weak in the long period of civil war only religion had proved strong in afghanistan in a period of 40 years of constant conflict the traditionalist islam of the taliban proved to be far more stable even if the order they brought was an impoverished peace\\u200a50–51 the taliban have been internationally condemned for their harsh enforcement of their interpretation of islamic sharia law which has resulted in their brutal treatment of many afghans during their rule from 1996 to 2001 the taliban enforced a strict interpretation of sharia or islamic law the taliban and their allies committed massacres against afghan civilians denied un food supplies to 160000 starving civilians and conducted a policy of scorched earth burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes while the taliban controlled afghanistan they banned activities and media including paintings photography and movies that depicted people or other living things they also prohibited music with instrumental accompaniments with the exception of the daf a type of frame drum the taliban prevented girls and young women from attending school banned women from working jobs outside of healthcare male doctors were prohibited from treating women and required that women be accompanied by a male relative and wear a burqa at all times when in public if women broke certain rules they were publicly whipped or executed the taliban harshly discriminated against religious and ethnic minorities during their rule and they have also committed a cultural genocide against the people of afghanistan by destroying numerous monuments including the famous 1500yearold buddhas of bamiyan according to the united nations the taliban and their allies were responsible for 76 of afghan civilian casualties in 2010 and 80 in 2011 and 2012 the group is internally funded by its involvement in the illegal drug trade which it participates in by producing and trafficking in narcotics such as heroin extortion and kidnapping for ransom they also seized control of mining operations in the mid2010s that were illegal under the previous government according to a 55page report by the united nations the taliban while trying to consolidate control over northern and western afghanistan committed systematic massacres against civilians un officials stated that there had been 15 massacres between 1996 and 2001 they also said that these have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the taliban ministry of defense or to mullah omar himself these are the same type of war crimes as were committed in bosnia and should be prosecuted in international courts one un official was quoted as saying the documents also reveal the role of arab and pakistani support troops in these killings bin ladens socalled 055 brigade was responsible for masskillings of afghan civilians the report by the united nations quotes eyewitnesses in many villages describing arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people the talibans former ambassador to pakistan mullah abdul salam zaeef in late 2011 stated that cruel behaviour under and by the taliban had been necessary in 1998 the united nations accused the taliban of denying emergency food by the uns world food programme to 160000 hungry and starving people for political and military reasons the un said the taliban were starving people for their military agenda and using humanitarian assistance as a weapon of war on 8 august 1998 the taliban launched an attack on mazarisharif of 1500 defenders only 100 survived the engagement once in control the taliban began to kill people indiscriminately at first shooting people in the street they soon began to target hazaras women were raped and thousands of people were locked in containers and left to suffocate this ethnic cleansing left an estimated 5000 to 6000 people dead at this time ten iranian diplomats and a journalist were killed iran assumed the taliban had murdered them and mobilised its army deploying men along the border with afghanistan by the middle of september there were 250000 iranian personnel stationed on the border pakistan mediated and the bodies were returned to tehran towards the end of the month the killings of the diplomats had been carried out by sipahesahaba a pakistani sunni group with close ties to the isi they burned orchards crops and destroyed irrigation systems and forced more than 100000 people from their homes with hundreds of men women and children still unaccounted for in a major effort to retake the shomali plains to the north of kabul from the united front the taliban indiscriminately killed civilians while uprooting and expelling the population among others kamal hossein a special reporter for the un reported on these and other war crimes in istalif a town famous for handmade potteries and which was home to more than 45000 people the taliban gave 24 hours notice to the population to leave then completely razed the town leaving the people destitute in 1999 the town of bamian was taken hundreds of men women and children were executed houses were razed and some were used for forced labour there was a further massacre at the town of yakaolang in january 2001 an estimated 300 people were murdered along with two delegations of hazara elders who had tried to intercede by 1999 the taliban had forced hundreds of thousands of people from the shomali plains and other regions conducting a policy of scorched earth burning homes farm land and gardens several taliban and alqaeda commanders ran a network of human trafficking abducting ethnic minority women and selling them into sex slavery in afghanistan and pakistan time magazine writes the taliban often argued that the restrictions they placed on women were actually a way of revering and protecting the opposite sex the behavior of the taliban during the six years they expanded their rule in afghanistan made a mockery of that claim the targets for human trafficking were especially women from the tajik uzbek hazara and other nonpashtun ethnic groups in afghanistan some women preferred to commit suicide over slavery killing themselves during one taliban and alqaeda offensive in 1999 in the shomali plains alone more than 600 women were kidnapped arab and pakistani alqaeda militants with local taliban forces forced them into trucks and buses time magazine writes the trail of the missing shomali women leads to jalalabad not far from the pakistan border there according to eyewitnesses the women were penned up inside sar shahi camp in the desert the more desirable among them were selected and taken away some were trucked to peshawar with the apparent complicity of pakistani border guards others were taken to khost where bin laden had several training camps officials from relief agencies say the trail of many of the vanished women leads to pakistan where they were sold to brothels or into private households to be kept as slaves not all taliban commanders engaged in human trafficking many taliban were opposed to the human trafficking operations conducted by alqaeda and other taliban commanders nuruludah a taliban commander is quoted as saying that in the shomali plains he and 10 of his men freed some women who were being abducted by pakistani members of alqaeda in jalalabad local taliban commanders freed women that were being held by arab members of alqaeda in a camp to phrs knowledge no other régime in the world has methodically and violently forced half of its population into virtual house arrest prohibiting them on pain of physical punishment brutal repression of women was widespread under the taliban and it received significant international condemnation  abuses were myriad and violently enforced by the religious police for example the taliban issued edicts forbidding women from being educated forcing girls to leave schools and colleges women who were leaving their houses were required to be accompanied by a male relative and were obligated to wear the burqa a traditional dress covering the entire body except for a small slit out of which to see those women who were accused of disobedience were publicly beaten in one instance a young woman named sohaila was charged with adultery after she was caught walking with a man who was not a relative she was publicly flogged in ghazi stadium receiving 100 lashes female employment was restricted to the medical sector where male medical personnel were prohibited from treating women and girls this extensive ban on the employment of women further resulted in the widespread closure of primary schools as almost all teachers prior to the talibans rise had been women further restricting access to education not only to girls but also to boys restrictions became especially severe after the taliban took control of the capital in february 1998 for instance religious police forced all women off the streets of kabul and issued new regulations which ordered people to blacken their windows so that women would not be visible from outside according to the united nations the taliban and its allies were responsible for 76 of civilian casualties in afghanistan in 2009 75 in 2010 and 80 in 2011 according to human rights watch the talibans bombings and other attacks which have led to civilian casualties sharply escalated in 2006 when at least 669 afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at noncombatants the united nations reported that the number of civilians killed by both the taliban and progovernment forces in the war rose nearly 50 between 2007 and 2009 the high number of civilians killed by the taliban is blamed in part on their increasing use of improvised explosive devices ieds for instance 16 ieds have been planted in girls schools by the taliban in 2009 colonel richard kemp formerly commander of british forces in afghanistan and the intelligence coordinator for the british government drew parallels between the tactics and strategy of hamas in gaza to those of the taliban kemp wrote like hamas in gaza the taliban in southern afghanistan are masters at shielding themselves behind the civilian population and then melting in among them for protection women and children are trained and equipped to fight collect intelligence and ferry arms and ammunition between battles female suicide bombers are increasingly common the use of women to shield gunmen as they engage nato forces is now so normal it is deemed barely worthy of comment schools and houses are routinely boobytrapped snipers shelter in houses deliberately filled with women and children hindus and sikhs have lived in afghanistan since historic times and they were prominent minorities in afghanistan wellestablished in terms of academics and businesses after the afghan civil war they started to migrate to india and other nations after the taliban established the islamic emirate of afghanistan they imposed strict sharia laws which discriminated against hindus and sikhs and caused the size of afghanistans hindu and sikh populations to fall at a very rapid rate because they emigrated from afghanistan and established diasporas in the western world the taliban issued decrees that forbade nonmuslims from building places of worship but allowed them to worship at existing holy sites forbade nonmuslims from criticizing muslims ordered nonmuslims to identify their houses by placing a yellow cloth on their rooftops forbade nonmuslims from living in the same residence as muslims and required that nonmuslim women wear a yellow dress with a special mark so that muslims could keep their distance from them hindus and sikhs were mainly targeted the taliban announced in may 2001 that it would force afghanistans hindu population to wear special badges which has been compared to the treatment of jews in nazi germany in general the taliban treated the sikhs and jews of afghanistan better than afghan shiites hindus and christians along with hindus the small christian community was also persecuted by the taliban violence against western aid workers and christians was common during afghan conflict on several occasions between 2008 and 2012 the taliban claimed that they assassinated western and afghani medical or aid workers in afghanistan because they feared that the polio vaccine would make muslim children sterile because they suspected that the medical workers were really spies or because they suspected that the medical workers were proselytizing christianity in august 2008 three western women british canadian us who were working for the aid group international rescue committee were murdered in kabul the taliban claimed that they killed them because they were foreign spies in october 2008 the british woman gayle williams working for christian uk charity serve afghanistan – focusing on training and education for disabled persons – was murdered near kabul taliban claimed they killed her because her organisation was preaching christianity in afghanistan in all 2008 until october 29 aid workers 5 of whom nonafghanis were killed in afghanistan in august 2010 the taliban claimed that they murdered 10 medical aid workers while they were passing through badakhshan province on their way from kabul to nuristan province – but the afghan islamic partymilitia hezbe islami gulbuddin has also claimed responsibility for those killings the victims were six americans one briton one german and two afghanis working for a selfproclaimed nonprofit christian organization which is named international assistance mission the taliban stated that they murdered them because they were proselytizing christianity and possessing which were translated into the dari language when they were encountered iam contended that they were not missionaries in december 2012 unidentified gunmen killed four female un polioworkers in karachi in pakistan the western news media suggested that there was a connection between the outspokenness of the taliban and objections to and suspicions of such polio vaccinations eventually in 2012 a pakistani taliban commander in north waziristan in pakistan banned polio vaccinations and in march 2013 the afghan government was forced to suspend its vaccination efforts in nuristan province because the taliban was extremely influential in the province however in may 2013 the talibans leaders changed their stance on polio vaccinations saying that the vaccine is the only way to prevent polio and they also stated that they will work with immunization volunteers as long as polio workers are unbiased and harmonized with the regional conditions islamic values and local cultural traditions during the first period of taliban rule only two known jews were left in afghanistan zablon simintov and isaac levy c 1920–2005 levy relied on charity to survive while simintov ran a store selling carpets and jewelry until 2001 they lived on opposite sides of the dilapidated kabul synagogue they kept denouncing each other to the authorities and both spent time in jail for continuously arguing the taliban also confiscated the synagogues torah scroll however the two men were later released from prison when taliban officials became annoyed by their arguing after august 2021 the last jew simintov and his relative left afghanistan ended centuries of jewish presence in this country before the taliban came to power education was highly regarded in afghanistan and kabul university attracted students from asia and the middle east however the taliban imposed restrictions on modern education banned the education of females only allowed islamic religious schools to stay open and only encouraged the teaching of the quran around half of all of the schools in afghanistan were destroyed the taliban have carried out brutal attacks on teachers and students and they have also threatened parents and teachers\\nas per a 1998 unicef report 9 out of 10 girls and 2 out of 3 boys did not enroll in schools by 2000 fewer than 4–5 of all afghan children were being educated at the primary school level and even fewer of them were being educated at higher secondary and university levels\\nattacks on educational institutions students and teachers and the forced enforcement of islamic teachings have even continued after the taliban were deposed from power in december 2017 united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha reported that over 1000 schools had been destroyed damaged or occupied and 100 teachers and students had been killed by the taliban the taliban have committed a cultural genocide against the afghan people by destroying their historical and cultural texts artifacts and sculptures in the early 1990s the national museum of afghanistan was attacked and looted numerous times resulting in the loss of 70 of the 100000 artifacts of afghan culture and history which were then on display on 11 august 1998 the taliban destroyed the puli khumri public library the library contained a collection of over 55000 books and old manuscripts one of the most valuable and beautiful collections of afghanistans cultural works according to the afghan people on 2 march 2001 the buddhas of bamiyan were destroyed with dynamite on orders from the talibans leader mullah omar\\nin october of the same year the taliban took sledgehammers and axes to thousands of years’ worth of artifacts in the national museum of afghanistan destroying at least 2750 ancient works of art afghanistan has a rich musical culture where music plays an important part in social functions like births and marriages and it has also played a major role in uniting an ethnically diverse country however since it came to power and even after it was deposed the taliban has banned most music including cultural folk music and it has also attacked and killed a number of musicians during their first rule of afghanistan which lasted from 1996 to 2001 the taliban banned many recreational activities and games such as association football kite flying and chess mediums of entertainment such as televisions cinemas music with instrumental accompaniments vcrs and satellite dishes were also banned also included on the list of banned items were musical instruments and accessories and all visual representation of living creatures however the daf a type of frame drum wasnt banned it was reported that when afghan children were caught kiting a highly popular activity they were beaten when khaled hosseini learned through a 1999 news report that the taliban had banned kite flying a restriction he found particularly cruel the news struck a personal chord for him as he had grown up with the sport while living in afghanistan hosseini was motivated to write a 25page short story about two boys who fly kites in kabul that he later developed into his first novel the kite runner according to the testimony of guantanamo captives before their combatant status review tribunals the taliban in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers also conscripted men to staff its civil service – both done at gunpoint according to a report from oxford university the taliban made widespread use of the conscription of children in 1997 1998 and 1999\\nthe report states that during the civil war that preceded the taliban régime thousands of orphaned boys joined various militia for employment food shelter protection and economic opportunity\\nthe report said that during its initial period the taliban long depended upon cohorts of youth witnesses stated that each landowning family had to provide one young man and 500 in expenses in august of that year 5000 students aged between 15 and 35 left madrassas in pakistan to join the taliban according to jon lee anderson the taliban government is said to be profoundly divided between the kandahar faction and the haqqani network with a mysterious dispearance of deputy prime minister abdul ghani baradar for several days in midseptember 2021 explained by rumours of injury after a brawl with other taliban  the kandahar faction is named for the city that mullah mohammed omar came from and where he founded the taliban and is described as insular and rural interested primarily with ruling its home turf it includes haibatullah akhundzada mullah yaqoob abdul ghani baradar see below the familybased haqqani network by contrast are closely linked to pakistans secret services interested in global jihad with its founder jalaluddin haqqani connected the taliban with osama bin laden it is named for its founder jalaluddin haqqani and is currently led by sirajuddin haqqani and includes khalil haqqani mawlawi mohammad salim saad\\nwith  sirajuddin haqqani as acting interior minister as of february 2022 the network has control of a preponderance of security positions in afghanistan taliban leadership have denied tension between factions suhail shaheen states there is one taliban and zabihullah mujahid acting deputy minister of information and culture evenmaintains there is no haqqani network the top members of the taliban as an insurgency as of august 2021 are all the top leadership of the taliban are ethnic pashtuns more specifically those belonging of the ghilzai confederation until his death in 2013 mullah mohammed omar was the supreme commander of the taliban mullah akhtar mansour was elected as his replacement in 2015 and following mansours killing in a may 2016 us drone strike mawlawi hibatullah akhundzada became the groups leader the taliban initially enjoyed goodwill from afghans weary of the warlords corruption brutality and incessant fighting\\nthis popularity was not universal particularly among nonpashtuns in 2001 the taliban de jure controlled 85 of afghanistan de facto the areas under its direct control were mainly afghanistans major cities and highways tribal khans and warlords had de facto direct control over various small towns villages and rural areas rashid described the taliban government as a secret society run by kandaharis  mysterious secretive and dictatorial they did not hold elections as their spokesman explained the sharia does not allow politics or political parties that is why we give no salaries to officials or soldiers just food clothes shoes and weapons we want to live a life like the prophet lived 1400 years ago and jihad is our right we want to recreate the time of the prophet and we are only carrying out what the afghan people have wanted for the past 14 years they modelled their decisionmaking process on the pashtun tribal council jirga together with what they believed to be the early islamic model discussion was followed by a building of a consensus by the believers before capturing kabul there was talk of stepping aside once a government of good muslims took power and law and order were restored as the talibans power grew decisions were made by mullah omar without consulting the jirga and without consulting other parts of the country he visited the capital kabul only twice while in power instead of an election their leaders legitimacy came from an oath of allegiance bayah in imitation of the prophet and the first four caliphs on 4 april 1996 mullah omar had the cloak of the prophet mohammed taken from its shrine for the first time in 60 years wrapping himself in the relic he appeared on the roof of a building in the center of kandahar while hundreds of pashtun mullahs below shouted amir almuminin commander of the faithful in a pledge of support taliban spokesman mullah wakil explained decisions are based on the advice of the amirul momineen for us consultation is not necessary we believe that this is in line with the sharia we abide by the amirs view even if he alone takes this view there will not be a head of state instead there will be an amir almuminin mullah omar will be the highest authority and the government will not be able to implement any decision to which he does not agree general elections are incompatible with sharia and therefore we reject them the taliban were very reluctant to share power and since their ranks were overwhelmingly pashtun they ruled as overlords over the 60 of afghans from other ethnic groups in local government such as kabul city council or herat taliban loyalists not locals dominated even when the pashtospeaking taliban could not communicate with the roughly half of the population who spoke dari or other nonpashtun tongues critics complained that this lack of local representation in urban administration made the taliban appear as an occupying force consistent with the governance of the early muslims was the absence of state institutions and the absence of a methodology for command and control both of which are standard today even in nonwesternized states the taliban did not issue press releases or policy statements nor did they hold regular press conferences the basis for this structure was grand mufti rashid ahmed ludhianvis obedience to the amir as he served as a mentor to the talibans leadership the outside world and most afghans did not even know what their leaders looked like because photography was banned the regular army resembled a lashkar or traditional tribal militia force with only 25000 men of whom 11000 were nonafghans cabinet ministers and deputies were mullahs with a madrasah education several of them such as the minister of health and the governor of the state bank were primarily military commanders who left their administrative posts and fought whenever they were needed military reverses that trapped them behind enemy lines or led to their deaths increased the chaos in the national administration at the national level all senior tajik uzbek and hazara bureaucrats were replaced with pashtuns whether qualified or not consequently the ministries by and large ceased to function the ministry of finance did not have a budget nor did it have a qualified economist or banker mullah omar collected and dispersed cash without bookkeeping the kabul money markets responded positively during the first weeks of the taliban occupation 1996 but the afghani soon fell in value they imposed a 50 tax on any company operating in the country and those who failed to pay were attacked they also imposed a 6 import tax on anything brought into the country and by 1998 had control of the major airports and border crossings which allowed them to establish a monopoly on all trade by 2001 the per capita income of the 25\\xa0million population was under 200 and the country was close to total economic collapse as of 2007 the economy had begun to recover with estimated foreign reserves of three billion dollars and a 13 increase in economic growth under the transit treaty between afghanistan and pakistan a massive network for smuggling developed it had an estimated turnover of 25\\xa0billion dollars with the taliban receiving between 100 and 130\\xa0million per year these operations along with the trade from the golden crescent financed the war in afghanistan and also had the side effect of destroying start up industries in pakistan ahmed rashid also explained that the afghan transit trade agreed on by pakistan was the largest official source of revenue for the taliban between 1996 and 1999 mullah omar reversed his opinions on the drug trade apparently as it only harmed kafirs the taliban controlled 96 of afghanistans poppy fields and made opium its largest source of taxation taxes on opium exports became one of the mainstays of taliban income and their war economy according to rashid drug money funded the weapons ammunition and fuel for the war in the new york times the finance minister of the united front wahidullah sabawoon declared the taliban had no annual budget but that they appeared to spend us300 million a year nearly all of it on war he added that the taliban had come to increasingly rely on three sources of money poppy the pakistanis and bin laden in an economic sense it seems he had little choice as the war of attrition continued with the northern alliance the income from continued opium production was all that prevented the country from starvation by 2000 afghanistan accounted for an estimated 75 of the worlds supply and in 2000 grew an estimated 3276 tonnes of opium from poppy cultivation on 82171 hectares at this juncture omar passed a decree banning the cultivation of opium and production dropped to an estimated 74 metric tonnes from poppy cultivation on 1685 hectares many observers say the ban – which came in a bid for international recognition at the united nations – was only issued in order to raise opium prices and increase profit from the sale of large existing stockpiles 1999 had yielded a record crop and had been followed by a lower but still large 2000 harvest the trafficking of accumulated stocks by the taliban continued in 2000 and 2001 in 2002 the un mentioned the existence of significant stocks of opiates accumulated during previous years of bumper harvests in september 2001 – before the 11 september attacks against the united states – the taliban allegedly authorised afghan peasants to sow opium again there was also an environmental toll to the country heavy deforestation from the illegal trade in timber with hundreds of acres of pine and cedar forests in kunar province and paktya being cleared throughout the country millions of acres were denuded to supply timber to the pakistani markets with no attempt made at reforestation which has led to significant environmental damage by 2001 when the afghan interim administration took power the countrys infrastructure was in ruins telecommunications had failed the road network was destroyed and ministry of finance buildings were in such a state of disrepair some were on the verge of collapse on 6 july 1999 then president bill clinton signed into effect executive order 13129 this order implemented a complete ban on any trade between america and the taliban régime and on 10 august they froze £5000000 in ariana assets on 19 december 2000 un resolution 1333 was passed it called for all assets to be frozen and for all states to close any offices belonging to the taliban this included the offices of ariana afghan airlines in 1999 the un had passed resolution 1267 which had banned all international flights by ariana apart from preapproved humanitarian missions according to the lawsuit filed in december 2019 in the dc district court on behalf of gold star families some us defense contractors involved in afghanistan made illegal protection payments to the taliban funding a talibanled terrorist insurgency that killed or wounded thousands of americans in afghanistan in 2009 thensecretary of state hillary clinton said that the protection money was one of the major sources of funding for the taliban it is estimated that in 2020 the taliban had an income of 16 billion mostly from drugs mining extortion and taxes donations and exports on 2 november 2021 the taliban required that all economic transactions in afghanistan use afghanis and banned the use of all foreign currency the taliban are supported by several militant outfits which include the haqqani network alqaeda and the islamic movement of uzbekistan several countries like china iran pakistan qatar russia and saudi arabia allegedly support the taliban however all of their governments deny providing any support to the taliban likewise the taliban also deny receiving any foreign support from any country at its peak formal diplomatic recognition of the talibans government was acknowledged by three nations pakistan saudi arabia and the united arab emirates in the past the united arab emirates and turkmenistan were also alleged to have provided support to the taliban it is designated by some countries as a terrorist organization during its time in power 1996–2001 at its height ruling 90 of afghanistan the taliban régime or islamic emirate of afghanistan gained diplomatic recognition from only three states the united arab emirates pakistan and saudi arabia all of which provided substantial aid the most other nations and organizations including the united nations recognised the government of the islamic state of afghanistan 1992–2002 parts of whom were part of the united front also called northern alliance as the legitimate government of afghanistan regarding its relations with the rest of the world the talibans emirate of afghanistan held a policy of isolationism the taliban believe in noninterference in the affairs of other countries and similarly desire no outside interference in their countrys internal affairs traditionally the taliban were supported by pakistan and saudi arabia while iran russia turkey india uzbekistan kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan formed an antitaliban alliance and supported the northern alliance after the fall of the taliban régime at the end of 2001 the composition of the taliban supporters changed according to a study by scholar antonio giustozzi in the years 2005 to 2015 most of the financial support came from the states pakistan saudi arabia iran china and qatar as well as from private donors from saudi arabia from alqaeda and for a short period of time from the islamic state about 54 percent of the funding came from foreign governments 10 percent from private donors from abroad and 16 percent from alqaeda and the islamic state in 2014 the amount of external support was close to 900 million following the talibans ascension to power the islamic emirate of afghanistans model of governance has been widely criticized by the international community despite the governments repeated calls for international recognition and engagement acting prime minister mohammad hassan akhund stated that his interim administration has met all conditions required for official recognition in a bid to gain recognition the taliban sent a letter in september 2021 to the un to accept suhail shaheen as permanent representative of the islamic emirate of afghanistan – a request that had already been rejected by the un credentials committee in 2021 on 10 october 2021 russia hosted the taliban for talks in moscow in an effort to boost its influence across central asia officials from 10 different countries – russia china pakistan india iran and five formerly soviet central asian states – attended the talks which were held during the talibans first official trip to europe since their return to power in midaugust 2021 the taliban won backing from the 10 regional powers for the idea of a united nations donor conference to help the country stave off economic collapse and a humanitarian catastrophe calling for the un to convene such a conference as soon as possible to help rebuild the country russian officials also called for action against islamic state is fighters who russia said have started to increase their presence in afghanistan since the talibans takeover the taliban delegation which was led by deputy prime minister abdul salam hanafi said that isolating afghanistan is in no ones interests arguing that the extremist group did not pose any security threat to any other country the taliban asked the international community to recognize its government but no country has yet recognized the new afghan government on 23 january 2022 a taliban delegation arrived in oslo and closeddoor meetings were held during the talibans first official trip to western europe and second official trip to europe since their return to power western diplomats told the taliban that humanitarian aid to afghanistan would be tied to an improvement in human rights the taliban delegation led by acting foreign minister amir khan muttaqi met senior french foreign ministry officials britains special envoy nigel casey eu special representative for afghanistan and members of the norwegian foreign ministry this followed the announcement by the un security council counterterrorism committee that the committee would extend a travel ban exemption until 21 march 2022 for 14 listed taliban members to continue attending talks along with a limited assetfreeze exemption for the financing of exempted travel however the afghan foreign minister amir khan muttaqi said that the international communitys call for the formation of an inclusive government was a political excuse after the 3day oslo visit at the united nations security council meeting in new york on 26 january 2022 norwegian prime minister jonas gahr store said the oslo talks appeared to have been serious and genuine norway says the talks do not represent a legitimisation or recognition of the taliban in the same meeting the russian federations delegate said attempts to engage the taliban through coercion are counterproductive calling on western states and donors to return frozen funds chinas representative said the fact that aid deliveries have not improved since the adoption of unsc 2615 2021 proves that the issue has been politicized as some parties seek to use assistance as a bargaining chip iran pakistan turkmenistan the russian federation and china were the first countries to accept the diplomatic credentials of talibanappointed envoys although this is not equivalent to official recognition the taliban movement was officially illegal in the following countries until 2022 former \\xa0united states 2002–2015 but never on the united states department of state list of foreign terrorist organizations despite the aid of united nations un and nongovernmental organisations ngos given see § afghanistan during taliban rule the talibans attitude in 1996–2001 toward the un and ngos was often one of suspicion the un did not recognise the taliban as the legitimate government of afghanistan most foreign donors and aid workers were nonmuslims and the taliban vented fundamental objections to the sort of help the un offered as the talibans attorney general maulvi jalilullah maulvizada put it in 1997 let us state what sort of education the un wants this is a big infidel policy which gives such obscene freedom to women which would lead to adultery and herald the destruction of islam in any islamic country where adultery becomes common that country is destroyed and enters the domination of the infidels because their men become like women and women cannot defend themselves anyone who talks to us should do so within islams framework the holy koran cannot adjust itself to other peoples requirements people should adjust themselves to the requirements of the holy koran in july 1998 the taliban closed all ngo offices by force after those organisations refused to move to a bombedout former polytechnic college as ordered one month later the un offices were also shut down around 2000 the un drew up sanctions against officials and leaders of taliban because of their harbouring osama bin laden several of the taliban leaders have subsequently been killed in 2009 british foreign secretary ed miliband and us secretary hillary clinton called for talks with regular taliban fighters while bypassing their top leaders who supposedly were committed to global jihad kai eide the top un official in afghanistan called for talks with taliban at the highest level suggesting mullah omar\\xa0– even though omar dismissed such overtures as long as foreign troops were in afghanistan in 2010 the un lifted sanctions on the taliban and requested that taliban leaders and others be removed from terrorism watch lists in 2010 the us and europe announced support for president karzais latest attempt to negotiate peace with the taliban the taliban were portrayed in khaled hosseinis popular 2003 novel the kite runner and its 2007 film adaption the taliban have also been portrayed in american film most notably in lone survivor 2013 which is based on a reallife story hindi cinema have also portrayed the taliban in kabul express 2006 and escape from taliban 2003 which is based on a reallife novel a kabuliwalas bengali wife whose author sushmita banerjee was shot dead by the taliban in 2013 former groups alleged but not proven nonstate allies alqaedaa is a sunni panislamist militant organization led by salafi jihadists who selfidentify as a vanguard spearheading a global islamist revolution to unite the muslim world under a supranational islamic state known as the caliphate its members are mostly composed of arabs but also include other peoples alqaeda has mounted attacks on civilian and military targets in various countries including the 1998 united states embassy bombings and the september 11 attacks it has been designated as a terrorist group by the united nations security council the north atlantic treaty organization nato the european union and various countries around the world the organization was founded in a series of meetings held in peshawar during 1988 attended by abdullah azzam osama bin laden muhammad atef ayman alzawahiri and other veterans of the soviet–afghan war building upon the networks of maktab alkhidamat the founding members decided to create an organization named alqaeda to serve as a vanguard for jihad following the withdrawal of the soviets in 1989 bin laden offered mujahideen support to saudi arabia in the gulf war in 1990–1991 his offer was rebuffed by the saudi government which instead sought the aid of the united states the stationing of us troops in saudi arabia prompted bin laden to declare a jihad against the house of saud whom he condemned as takfir apostates from islam and against the us during 1992–1996 alqaeda established its headquarters in sudan until it was expelled in 1996 it shifted its base to the talibanruled afghanistan and later expanded to other parts of the world primarily in the middle east and south asia in 1996 and 1998 bin laden issued two fatāwā calling for us troops to leave saudi arabia alqaeda conducted the 1998 united states embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania which killed 224 people the us retaliated by launching operation infinite reach against alqaeda targets in afghanistan and sudan in 2001 alqaeda carried out the september 11 attacks resulting in nearly 3000 fatalities substantial longterm health consequences and damaging global economic markets the us launched the war on terror in response and invaded afghanistan to depose the taliban and destroy alqaeda in 2003 a usled coalition invaded iraq overthrowing the baathist regime which they wrongly accused of having ties with alqaeda in 2004 alqaeda launched its iraqi regional branch after pursuing him for almost a decade the us military killed bin laden in pakistan in may 2011 alqaeda members believe a judeochristian alliance led by the united states is conspiring to be at war against islam and destroy islam as salafist jihadists members of alqaeda believe that killing noncombatants is religiously sanctioned alqaeda also opposes what it regards as manmade laws and wants to replace them exclusively with a strict form of sharīʿa islamic religious law which is perceived as divine law they characteristically deploy tactics such as suicide attacks inghimasi and istishhadi operations involving simultaneous bombing of several targets in battlezones alqaedas iraq branch which later morphed into the islamic state of iraq and levant was responsible for numerous sectarian attacks against shias during its iraqi insurgency alqaeda ideologues envision the violent removal of all foreign and secular influences in muslim countries which it denounces as corrupt deviations following the death of bin laden in 2011 alqaeda vowed to avenge his killing the group was then led by egyptian ayman alzawahiri until his death in 2022 as of 2021update they have reportedly suffered from a deterioration of central command over its regional operations alqaeda only indirectly controls its daytoday operations its philosophy calls for the centralization of decision making while allowing for the decentralization of execution the top leaders of alqaeda have defined the organizations ideology and guiding strategy and they have also articulated simple and easytoreceive messages at the same time midlevel organizations were given autonomy but they had to consult with top management before largescale attacks and assassinations top management included the shura council as well as committees on military operations finance and information sharing through the information committees of alqaeda zawahiri placed special emphasis on communicating with his groups however after the war on terror alqaedas leadership has become isolated as a result the leadership has become decentralized and the organization has become regionalized into several alqaeda groups many terrorism experts do not believe that the global jihadist movement is driven at every level by alqaedas leadership however bin laden held considerable ideological sway over some muslim extremists before his death experts argue that alqaeda has fragmented into a number of disparate regional movements and that these groups bear little connection with one another this view mirrors the account given by osama bin laden in his october 2001 interview with tayseer allouni this matter isnt about any specific person and\\xa0 is not about the alqaidah organization we are the children of an islamic nation with prophet muhammad as its leader our lord is one\\xa0 and all the true believers mumineen are brothers so the situation isnt like the west portrays it that there is an organization with a specific name such as alqaidah and so on that particular name is very old it was born without any intention from us brother abu ubaida\\xa0 created a military base to train the young men to fight against the vicious arrogant brutal terrorizing soviet empire\\xa0 so this place was called the base alqaidah as in a training base so this name grew and became we arent separated from this nation we are the children of a nation and we are an inseparable part of it and from those public demonstrations which spread from the far east from the philippines to indonesia to malaysia to india to pakistan reaching mauritania\\xa0 and so we discuss the conscience of this nation as of 2010update however bruce hoffman saw alqaeda as a cohesive network that was strongly led from the pakistani tribal areas alqaeda has the following direct affiliates the following are presently believed to be indirect affiliates of alqaeda alqaedas former affiliates include the following osama bin laden served as the emir of alqaeda from the organizations founding in 1988 until his assassination by us forces on may 1 2011 atiyah abd alrahman was alleged to be second in command prior to his death on august 22 2011 bin laden was advised by a shura council which consists of senior alqaeda members the group was estimated to consist of 20–30 people ayman alzawahiri had been alqaedas deputy emir and assumed the role of emir following bin ladens death alzawahiri replaced saif aladel who had served as interim commander on june 5 2012 pakistani intelligence officials announced that alrahmans alleged successor as second in command abu yahya allibi had been killed in pakistan nasir alwuhayshi was alleged to have become alqaedas overall second in command and general manager in 2013 he was concurrently the leader of alqaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap until he was killed by a us airstrike in yemen in june 2015 abu khayr almasri wuhayshis alleged successor as the deputy to ayman alzawahiri was killed by a us airstrike in syria in february 2017 al qaedas next alleged number two leader abdullah ahmed abdullah was killed by israeli agents his pseudonym was abu muhammad almasri who was killed in november 2020 in iran he was involved in the 1998 bombings of the us embassies in kenya and tanzania alqaedas network was built from scratch as a conspiratorial network which drew upon the leadership of a number of regional nodes the organization divided itself into several committees which include alzawahiri was killed on july 31 2022 in a drone strike in afghanistan in february 2023 a report from the united nations based on member state intelligence concluded that de facto leadership of alqaeda had passed to saif aladel who was operating out of iran adel a former egyptian army officer became a military instructor in alqaeda camps in the 1990s and was known for his involvement in the battle of mogadishu the report stated that aladels leadership could not officially be declared by alqaeda because of political sensitivities of afghan government in acknowledging the death of alzawahiri as well as due to theological and operational challenges posed by the location of aladel in iran most of al qaedas top leaders and operational directors were veterans who fought against the soviet invasion of afghanistan in the 1980s osama bin laden and his deputy ayman alzawahiri were the leaders who were considered the operational commanders of the organization nevertheless alqaeda is not operationally managed by ayman alzawahiri several operational groups exist which consult with the leadership in situations where attacks are in preparation alqaeda central aqc is a conglomerate of expert committees each in supervision of distinct tasks and objectives its membership is mostly composed of egyptian islamist leaders who participated in the anticommunist afghan jihad assisting them are hundreds of islamic field operatives and commanders based in various regions of the muslim world the central leadership assumes control of the doctrinal approach and overall propaganda campaign while the regional commanders were empowered with independence in military strategy and political maneuvering this novel hierarchy made it possible for the organisation to launch widerange offensives when asked in 2005 about the possibility of alqaedas connection to the july 7 2005 london bombings metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair said alqaeda is not an organization alqaeda is a way of working\\xa0 but this has the hallmark of that approach\\xa0 alqaeda clearly has the ability to provide training\\xa0 to provide expertise\\xa0 and i think that is what has occurred here on august 13 2005 the independent newspaper reported that the july\\xa07 bombers had acted independently of an alqaeda mastermind nasser albahri who was osama bin ladens bodyguard for four years in the runup to 911 wrote in his memoir a highly detailed description of how the group functioned at that time albahri described alqaedas formal administrative structure and vast arsenal however the author adam curtis argued that the idea of alqaeda as a formal organization is primarily an american invention curtis contended the name alqaeda was first brought to the attention of the public in the 2001 trial of bin laden and the four men accused of the 1998 us embassy bombings in east africa curtis wrote the reality was that bin laden and ayman alzawahiri had become the focus of a loose association of disillusioned islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy but there was no organization these were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin laden for funding and assistance he was not their commander there is also no evidence that bin laden used the term alqaeda to refer to the name of a group until after september 11 attacks when he realized that this was the term the americans had given it during the 2001 trial the us department of justice needed to show that bin laden was the leader of a criminal organization in order to charge him in absentia under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act the name of the organization and details of its structure were provided in the testimony of jamal alfadl who said he was a founding member of the group and a former employee of bin laden questions about the reliability of alfadls testimony have been raised by a number of sources because of his history of dishonesty and because he was delivering it as part of a plea bargain agreement after being convicted of conspiring to attack us military establishments sam schmidt a defense attorney who defended alfadl said there were selective portions of alfadls testimony that i believe was false to help support the picture that he helped the americans join together i think he lied in a number of specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was it made alqaeda the new mafia or the new communists it made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with alqaeda for any acts or statements made by bin laden the number of individuals in the group who have undergone proper military training and are capable of commanding insurgent forces is largely unknown documents captured in the raid on bin ladens compound in 2011 show that the core alqaeda membership in 2002 was 170 in 2006 it was estimated that alqaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 countries as of 2009update it was believed that no more than 200–300 members were still active commanders according to the 2004 bbc documentary the power of nightmares alqaeda was so weakly linked together that it was hard to say it existed apart from bin laden and a small clique of close associates the lack of any significant numbers of convicted alqaeda members despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges was cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of alqaeda existed alqaedas commanders as well as its sleeping agents are hiding in different parts of the world to this day they are mainly hunted by the american and israeli secret services according to author robert cassidy alqaeda maintains two separate forces which are deployed alongside insurgents in iraq and pakistan the first numbering in the tens of thousands was organized trained and equipped as insurgent combat forces in the soviet–afghan war the force was composed primarily of foreign mujahideen from saudi arabia and yemen many of these fighters went on to fight in bosnia and somalia for global jihad another group which numbered 10000 in 2006 live in the west and have received rudimentary combat training other analysts have described alqaedas rank and file as being predominantly arab in its first years of operation but that the organization also includes other peoples as of 2007update it has been estimated that 62 percent of alqaeda members have a university education in 2011 and the following year the americans successfully settled accounts with osama bin laden anwar alawlaki the organizations chief propagandist and abu yahya allibis deputy commander the optimistic voices were already saying it was over for alqaeda nevertheless it was around this time that the arab spring greeted the region the turmoil of which came great to alqaedas regional forces seven years later ayman alzawahiri became arguably the number one leader in the organization implementing his strategy with systematic consistency tens of thousands loyal to alqaeda and related organizations were able to challenge local and regional stability and ruthlessly attack their enemies in the middle east africa south asia southeast asia europe and russia alike in fact from northwest africa to south asia alqaeda had more than two dozen franchisebased allies the number of alqaeda militants was set at 20000 in syria alone and they had 4000 members in yemen and about 7000 in somalia the war was not over in 2001 alqaeda had around 20 functioning cells and 70000 insurgents spread over sixty nations according to latest estimates the number of activeduty soldiers under its command and allied militias have risen to approximately 250000 by 2018 alqaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks and very rarely makes wire transfers in the 1990s financing came partly from the personal wealth of osama bin laden other sources of income included the heroin trade and donations from supporters in kuwait saudi arabia and other islamic gulf states a wikileaksreleased 2009 internal us government cable stated that terrorist funding emanating from saudi arabia remains a serious concern among the first pieces of evidence regarding saudi arabias support for alqaeda was the socalled golden chain a list of early alqaeda funders seized during a 2002 raid in sarajevo by bosnian police the handwritten list was validated by alqaeda defector jamal alfadl and included the names of both donors and beneficiaries osama binladens name appeared seven times among the beneficiaries while 20 saudi and gulfbased businessmen and politicians were listed among the donors notable donors included adel batterjee and wael hamza julaidan batterjee was designated as a terror financier by the us department of the treasury in 2004 and julaidan is recognized as one of alqaedas founders documents seized during the 2002 bosnia raid showed that alqaeda widely exploited charities to channel financial and material support to its operatives across the globe notably this activity exploited the international islamic relief organization iiro and the muslim world league mwl the iiro had ties with alqaeda associates worldwide including alqaedas deputy ayman al zawahiri zawahiris brother worked for the iiro in albania and had actively recruited on behalf of alqaeda the mwl was openly identified by alqaedas leader as one of the three charities alqaeda primarily relied upon for funding sources several qatari citizens have been accused of funding alqaeda this includes abd alrahman alnuaimi a qatari citizen and a humanrights activist who founded the swissbased nongovernmental organization ngo alkarama on december 18 2013 the us treasury designated nuaimi as a terrorist for his activities supporting alqaeda the us treasury has said nuaimi has facilitated significant financial support to alqaeda in iraq and served as an interlocutor between alqaeda in iraq and qatarbased donors nuaimi was accused of overseeing a 2\\xa0million monthly transfer to alqaeda in iraq as part of his role as mediator between iraqbased alqaeda senior officers and qatari citizens nuaimi allegedly entertained relationships with abukhalid alsuri alqaedas top envoy in syria who processed a 600000 transfer to alqaeda in 2013 nuaimi is also known to be associated with abd alwahhab muhammad abd alrahman alhumayqani a yemeni politician and founding member of alkarama who was listed as a specially designated global terrorist sdgt by the us treasury in 2013 the us authorities claimed that humayqani exploited his role in alkarama to fundraise on behalf of alqaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap a prominent figure in aqap nuaimi was also reported to have facilitated the flow of funding to aqap affiliates based in yemen nuaimi was also accused of investing funds in the charity directed by humayqani to ultimately fund aqap about ten months after being sanctioned by the us treasury nuaimi was also restrained from doing business in the uk another qatari citizen kalifa mohammed turki subayi was sanctioned by the us treasury on june 5 2008 for his activities as a gulfbased alqaeda financier subayis name was added to the un security councils sanctions list in 2008 on charges of providing financial and material support to alqaeda senior leadership subayi allegedly moved alqaeda recruits to south asiabased training camps he also financially supported khalid sheikh mohammed a pakistani national and senior alqaeda officer who is believed to be the mastermind behind the september 11 attack according to the 911 commission report qataris provided support to alqaeda through the countrys largest ngo the qatar charity alqaeda defector alfadl who was a former member of qatar charity testified in court that abdullah mohammed yusef who served as qatar charitys director was affiliated to alqaeda and simultaneously to the national islamic front a political group that gave alqaeda leader osama bin laden harbor in sudan in the early 1990s it was alleged that in 1993 osama bin laden was using middle east based sunni charities to channel financial support to alqaeda operatives overseas the same documents also report bin ladens complaint that the failed assassination attempt of egyptian president hosni mubarak had compromised the ability of alqaeda to exploit charities to support its operatives to the extent it was capable of before 1995citation needed qatar financed alqaedas enterprises through alqaedas former affiliate in syria jabhat alnusra the funding was primarily channeled through kidnapping for ransom the consortium against terrorist finance catf reported that the gulf country has funded alnusra since 2013 in 2017 asharq alawsat estimated that qatar had disbursed 25\\xa0million in support of alnusra through kidnapping for ransom in addition qatar has launched fundraising campaigns on behalf of alnusra alnusra acknowledged a qatarsponsored campaign as one of the preferred conduits for donations intended for the group in the disagreement over whether alqaedas objectives are religious or political mark sedgwick describes alqaedas strategy as political in the immediate term but with ultimate aims that are religious\\non march 11 2005 alquds alarabi published extracts from saif aladels document al qaedas strategy to the year 2020 abdel bari atwan summarizes this strategy as comprising five stages to rid the ummah from all forms of oppression atwan noted that while the plan is unrealistic it is sobering to consider that this virtually describes the downfall of the soviet union according to fouad hussein a jordanian journalist and author who has spent time in prison with alzarqawi alqaedas strategy consists of seven phases and is similar to the plan described in al qaedas strategy to the year 2020 these phases include according to the sevenphase strategy the war is projected to last less than two years according to charles lister of the middle east institute and katherine zimmerman of the american enterprise institute the new model of alqaeda is to socialize communities and build a broad territorial base of operations with the support of local communities also gaining income independent of the funding of sheiks the english name of the organization is a simplified transliteration of the arabic noun alqāʿidah \\u200fالقاعدة\\u200e which means the foundation or the base the initial al is the arabic definite article the hence the base in arabic alqaeda has four syllables alˈqaːʕida however since two of the arabic consonants in the name are not phones found in the english language the common naturalized english pronunciations include ælˈkaɪdə ælˈkeɪdə and ˌælkɑːˈiːdə alqaedas name can also be transliterated as alqaida alqaida or elqaida the doctrinal concept of alqaeda was first coined by the palestinian islamist scholar and jihadist leader abdullah azzam in an april 1988 issue of aljihad magazine to describe a religiously committed vanguard of muslims who wage armed jihad globally to liberate oppressed muslims from foreign invaders establish sharia islamic law across the islamic world by overthrowing the ruling secular governments and thus restore the past islamic prowess this was to be implemented by establishing an islamic state that would nurture generations of muslim soldiers that would perpetually attack united states and its allied governments in the muslim world numerous historical models were cited by azzam as successful examples of his call starting from the early muslim conquests of the 7th century to the recent antisoviet afghan jihad of 1980s according to azzams worldview it is about time to think about a state that would be a solid base for the distribution of the islamic creed and a fortress to host the preachers from the hell of the jahiliyyah the preislamic period bin laden explained the origin of the term in a videotaped interview with al jazeera journalist tayseer alouni in october 2001 the name alqaeda was established a long time ago by mere chance the late abu ebeida elbanashiri established the training camps for our mujahedeen against russias terrorism we used to call the training camp alqaeda the name stayed it has been argued that two documents seized from the sarajevo office of the benevolence international foundation prove the name was not simply adopted by the mujahideen movement and that a group called alqaeda was established in august 1988 both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group and contain the term alqaeda former british foreign secretary robin cook wrote that the word alqaeda should be translated as the database because it originally referred to the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen militants who were recruited and trained with cia help to defeat the russians in april 2002 the group assumed the name qaidat aljihad قاعدة الجهاد qāʿidat aljihād which means the base of jihad according to diaa rashwan this was apparently as a result of the merger of the overseas branch of egypts aljihad which was led by ayman alzawahiri with the groups bin laden brought under his control after his return to afghanistan in the mid1990s political militant islam portal the militant islamist salafist movement of alqaeda developed during the islamic revival and the rise of the islamist movement after the iranian revolution 1978–1979 and the afghan jihad 19791989 many scholars have argued that the writings of islamic author and thinker sayyid qutb inspired the alqaeda organization in the 1950s and 1960s qutb preached that because of the lack of sharia law the muslim world was no longer muslim and had reverted to the preislamic ignorance known as jahiliyyah to restore islam qutb argued that a vanguard of righteous muslims was needed in order to establish true islamic states implement sharia and rid the muslim world of any nonmuslim influences in qutbs view the enemies of islam included world jewry which plotted conspiracies and opposed islam qutb envisioned this vanguard to march forward to wage armed jihad against tyrannical regimes after purifying from the wider jahili societies and organising themselves under a righteous islamic leadership which he viewed as the model of early muslims in the islamic state of medina under the leadership of islamic prophet muhammad this idea would directly influence many islamist figures such as abdullah azzam and usama bin laden and became the core rationale for the formulation of alqaeda concept in the near future outlining his strategy to topple the existing secular orders qutb argued in milestones it is necessary that a muslim community to come into existence which believes that ‘there is no deity except god’ which commits itself to obey none but god denying all other authority and which challenges the legality of any law which is not based on this belief  it should come into the battlefield with the determination that its strategy its social organization and the relationship between its individuals should be firmer and more powerful than the existing jahili system in the words of mohammed jamal khalifa a close college friend of bin laden islam is different from any other religion its a way of life we khalifa and bin laden were trying to understand what islam has to say about how we eat who we marry how we talk we read sayyid qutb he was the one who most affected our generation qutb also influenced ayman alzawahiri zawahiris uncle and maternal family patriarch mafouz azzam was qutbs student protégé personal lawyer and an executor of his estate azzam was one of the last people to see qutb alive before his execution zawahiri paid homage to qutb in his work knights under the prophets banner qutb argued that many muslims were not true muslims some muslims qutb argued were apostates these alleged apostates included leaders of muslim countries since they failed to enforce sharia law he also alleged that the west approaches the muslim world with a crusading spirit in spite of the decline of religious values in the 20th century europe according to qutb the hostile and imperialist attitudes exhibited by europeans and americans towards muslim countries their support for zionism etc reflected hatred amplified over a millennia of wars such as the crusades and was born out of roman materialist and utilitarian outlooks that viewed the world in monetary terms the afghan jihad against the prosoviet government further developed the salafist jihadist movement which inspired alqaeda during this period alqaeda embraced the ideals of the south asian militant revivalist sayyid ahmad shahid d 18311246 ah who led a jihad movement against british india from the frontiers of afghanistan and khyberpakhtunkwa in the early 19th century alqaeda readily adopted sayyid ahmads doctrines such as returning to the purity of early generations salaf assalih antipathy towards western influences and restoration of islamic political power according to pakistani journalist hussain haqqani sayyid ahmeds revival of the ideology of jihad became the prototype for subsequent islamic militant movements in south and central asia and is also the main influence over the jihad network of al qaeda and its associated groups in the region the longterm objective of alqaeda is to unite the muslim world under a supranational islamic state known as the khilafah caliphate headed by an elected caliph descended from the ahl albayt prophetic family the immediate objectives include the expulsion of american troops from the arabian peninsula waging armed jihad to topple usallied governments in the region etc the following are the goals and some of the general policies outlined in alqaedas founding charter alqaedas structure and bylaws issued in the meetings in peshawar in 1988 general goals i to promote jihad awareness in the islamic world\\nii to prepare and equip the cadres for the islamic world through trainings and by participating in actual combat\\niii to support and sponsor the jihad movement as much as possible\\niv to coordinate jihad movements around the world in an effort to create a unified international jihad movement general policies\\n1 complete commitment to the governing rules and controls of shari‘a in all the beliefs and actions and according to the book qur’an and sunna as well as per the interpretation of the nation’s scholars who serve in this domain\\n2 commitment to jihad as a fight for god’s cause and as an agenda of change and to prepare for it and apply it whenever we find it possible\\n4 our position with respect to the tyrants of the world secular and national parties and the like is not to associate with them to discredit them and to be their constant enemy till they believe in god alone we shall not agree with them on halfsolutions and there is no way to negotiate with them or appease them\\n5 our relationships with truthful islamic jihadist movements and groups is to cooperate under the umbrella of faith and belief and we shall always attempt to at uniting and integrating

attempt to recruit them\\n11 we shall maintain our economic independence and will not rely on others to secure our resources\\n12 secrecy is the main ingredient of our work except for what the need deems necessary to reveal 13 our policy with the afghani jihad is support advise and coordination with the islamic establishments in jihad arenas in a manner that conforms with our policies alqaeda aims to establish an islamic state in the arab world modelled after the rashidun caliphate by initiating a global jihad against the international jewishcrusader alliance led by the united states which it sees as the external enemy and against the secular governments in muslim countries that are described as the apostate domestic enemy once foreign influences and the secular ruling authorities are removed from muslim countries through jihad alqaeda supports elections to choose the rulers of its proposed islamic states this is to be done through representatives of leadership councils shura that would ensure the implementation of sharia islamic law however it opposes elections that institute parliaments which empower muslim and nonmuslim legislators to collaborate in making laws of their own choosing in the second edition of his book knights under the banner of the prophet ayman al zawahiri writes we demand the government of the rightly guiding caliphate which is established on the basis of the sovereignty of sharia and not on the whims of the majority its ummah chooses its rulersif they deviate the ummah brings them to account and removes them the ummah participates in producing that governments decisions and determining its direction  the caliphal state commands the right and forbids the wrong and engages in jihad to liberate muslim lands and to free all humanity from all oppression and ignorance a recurring theme in alqaedas ideology is the perpetual grievance over the violent subjugation of islamic dissidents by the authoritarian secularist regimes allied to the west alqaeda denounces these postcolonial governments as a system led by westernised elites designed to advance neocolonialism and maintain western hegemony over the muslim world the most prominent topic of grievance is over the american foreign policy in the arab world especially over its strong economic and military support to israel other concerns of resentment include presence of nato troops to support allied regimes injustices committed against muslims in kashmir chechnya xinjiang syria afghanistan iraq etc abdel bari atwan wrote that while the leaderships own theological platform is essentially salafi the organizations umbrella is sufficiently wide to encompass various schools of thought and political leanings alqaeda counts among its members and supporters people associated with wahhabism shafiism malikism and hanafism there are even some alqaeda members whose beliefs and practices are directly at odds with salafism such as yunis khalis one of the leaders of the afghan mujahedin he was a mystic who visited the tombs of saints and sought their blessings\\xa0– practices inimical to bin ladens wahhabisalafi school of thought the only exception to this panislamic policy is shiism alqaeda seems implacably opposed to it as it holds shiism to be heresy in iraq it has openly declared war on the badr brigades who have fully cooperated with the us and now considers even shii civilians to be legitimate targets for acts of violence on the other hand professor peter mandaville states that alqaeda follows a pragmatic policy in forming its local affiliates with various cells being subcontracted to shia muslim and nonmuslim members the topdown chain of command means that each unit is answerable directly to central leadership while they remain ignorant of their counterparts presence or activities these transnational networks of autonomous supply chains financiers underground militias and political supporters were set up during the 1990s when bin ladens immediate aim was the expulsion of american troops from the arabian peninsula following its 911 attack and in response to its condemnation by islamic scholars alqaeda provided a justification for the killing of noncombatantscivilians entitled a statement from qaidat aljihad regarding the mandates of the heroes and the legality of the operations in new york and washington according to a couple of critics quintan wiktorowicz and john kaltner it provides ample theological justification for killing civilians in almost any imaginable situation among these justifications are that america is leading the west in waging a war on islam so that attacks on america are a defense of islam and any treaties and agreements between muslim majority states and western countries that would be violated by attacks are null and void according to the tract several conditions allow for the killing of civilians including alqaeda has carried out a total of six major attacks four of them in its jihad against america in each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities to prevent the former afghan king mohammed zahir shah from coming back from exile and possibly becoming head of a new government bin laden instructed a portuguese convert to islam paulo jose de almeida santos to assassinate zahir shah on november 4 1991 santos entered the kings villa in rome posing as a journalist and tried to stab him with a dagger a tin of cigarillos in the kings breast pocket deflected the blade and saved zahir shahs life santos was apprehended and jailed for 10 years in italy on december 29 1992 alqaeda launched the 1992 yemen hotel bombings two bombs were detonated in aden yemen the first target was the movenpick hotel and the second was the parking lot of the goldmohur hotel the bombings were an attempt to eliminate american soldiers on their way to somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort operation restore hope internally alqaeda considered the bombing a victory that frightened the americans away but in the us the attack was barely noticed no american soldiers were killed because no soldiers were staying in the hotel at the time it was bombed however an australian tourist and a yemeni hotel worker were killed in the bombing seven others who were mostly yemeni were severely injured two fatwas are said to have been appointed by alqaedas members mamdouh mahmud salim to justify the killings according to islamic law salim referred to a famous fatwa appointed by ibn taymiyyah a 13thcentury scholar admired by wahhabis which sanctioned resistance by any means during the mongol invasionsunreliable source in 1996 bin laden personally engineered a plot to assassinate united states president bill clinton while the president was in manila for the asiapacific economic cooperation however intelligence agents intercepted a message before the motorcade was to leave and alerted the us secret service agents later discovered a bomb planted under a bridge on august 7 1998 alqaeda bombed the us embassies in east africa killing 224 people including 12 americans in retaliation a barrage of cruise missiles launched by the us military devastated an alqaeda base in khost afghanistan the networks capacity was unharmed in late 1999 and 2000 alqaeda planned attacks to coincide with the millennium masterminded by abu zubaydah and involving abu qatada which would include the bombing of christian holy sites in jordan the bombing of los angeles international airport by ahmed ressam and the bombing of the uss\\xa0the sullivans\\xa0ddg68 on october 12 2000 alqaeda militants in yemen bombed the missile destroyer uss cole in a suicide attack killing 17 us servicemen and damaging the vessel while it lay offshore inspired by the success of such a brazen attack alqaedas command core began to prepare for an attack on the us itself the september 11 attacks on america by alqaeda killed 2996 people\\xa0– 2507 civilians 343 firefighters 72 law enforcement officers 55 military personnel as well as 19 hijackers who committed murdersuicide two commercial airliners were deliberately flown into the twin towers of the world trade center a third into the pentagon and a fourth originally intended to target either the united states capitol or the white house crashed in a field in stonycreek township near shanksville pennsylvania after passengers revolted it was the deadliest foreign attack on american soil since the japanese attack on pearl harbor on december 7 1941 and to this day remains the deadliest terrorist attack in human history the attacks were conducted by alqaeda acting in accord with the 1998 fatwa issued against the us and its allies by persons under the command of bin laden alzawahiri and others evidence points to suicide squads led by alqaeda military commander mohamed atta as the culprits of the attacks with bin laden ayman alzawahiri khalid sheikh mohammed and hambali as the key planners and part of the political and military command messages issued by bin laden after september 11 2001 praised the attacks and explained their motivation while denying any involvement bin laden legitimized the attacks by identifying grievances felt by both mainstream and islamist muslims such as the general perception that the us was actively oppressing muslims bin laden asserted that america was massacring muslims in palestine chechnya kashmir and iraq and muslims should retain the right to attack in reprisal he also claimed the 911 attacks were not targeted at people but americas icons of military and economic power despite the fact he planned to attack in the morning when most of the people in the intended targets were present and thus generating the maximum number of human casualties evidence later came to light that the original targets for the attack may have been nuclear power stations on the us east coast the targets were later altered by alqaeda as it was feared that such an attack might get out of hand alqaeda is deemed a designated terrorist group by the following countries and international organizations in the immediate aftermath of the 911 attacks the us government responded and began to prepare its armed forces to overthrow the taliban which it believed was harboring alqaeda the us offered taliban leader mullah omar a chance to surrender bin laden and his top associates the first forces to be inserted into afghanistan were paramilitary officers from the cias elite special activities division sad the taliban offered to turn over bin laden to a neutral country for trial if the us would provide evidence of bin ladens complicity in the attacks us president george w bush responded by saying we know hes guilty turn him over and british prime minister tony blair warned the taliban regime surrender bin laden or surrender power soon thereafter the us and its allies invaded afghanistan and together with the afghan northern alliance removed the taliban government as part of the war in afghanistan as a result of the us special forces and air support for the northern alliance ground forces a number of taliban and alqaeda training camps were destroyed and much of the operating structure of alqaeda is believed to have been disrupted after being driven from their key positions in the tora bora area of afghanistan many alqaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged gardez region of the nation by early 2002 alqaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity and the afghan invasion appeared to be a success nevertheless a significant taliban insurgency remained in afghanistan debate continued regarding the nature of alqaedas role in the 911 attacks the us state department released a videotape showing bin laden speaking with a small group of associates somewhere in afghanistan shortly before the taliban was removed from power although its authenticity has been questioned by a couple of people the tape definitively implicates bin laden and alqaeda in the september 11 attacks the tape was aired on many television channels with an accompanying english translation provided by the us defense department in september 2004 the 911 commission officially concluded that the attacks were conceived and implemented by alqaeda operatives in october 2004 bin laden appeared to claim responsibility for the attacks in a videotape released through al jazeera saying he was inspired by israeli attacks on highrises in the 1982 invasion of lebanon as i looked at those demolished towers in lebanon it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in america in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children by the end of 2004 the us government proclaimed that twothirds of the most senior alqaeda figures from 2001 had been captured and interrogated by the cia abu zubaydah ramzi bin alshibh and abd alrahim alnashiri in 2002 khalid sheikh mohammed in 2003 and saif al islam el masry in 2004 mohammed atef and several others were killed the west was criticized for not being able to handle alqaida despite a decade of the war alqaeda involvement in africa has included a number of bombing attacks in north africa while supporting parties in civil wars in eritrea and somalia from 1991 to 1996 bin laden and other alqaeda leaders were based in sudan islamist rebels in the sahara calling themselves alqaeda in the islamic maghreb have stepped up their violence in recent years french officials say the rebels have no real links to the alqaeda leadership but this has been disputed it seems likely that bin laden approved the groups name in late 2006 and the rebels took on the al qaeda franchise label almost a year before the violence began to escalate in mali the ansar dine faction was also reported as an ally of alqaeda in 2013 the ansar al dine faction aligned themselves with the aqim in 2011 alqaedas north african wing condemned libyan leader muammar gaddafi and declared support for the antigaddafi rebels following the libyan civil war the removal of gaddafi and the ensuing period of postcivil war violence in libya various islamist militant groups affiliated with alqaeda were able to expand their operations in the region the 2012 benghazi attack which resulted in the death of us ambassador j christopher stevens and three other americans is suspected of having been carried out by various jihadist networks such as alqaeda in the islamic maghreb ansar alsharia and several other alqaeda affiliated groups the capture of nazih abdulhamed alruqai a senior alqaeda operative wanted by the united states for his involvement in the 1998 united states embassy bombings on october 5 2013 by us navy seals fbi and cia agents illustrates the importance the us and other western allies have placed on north africa prior to the september 11 attacks alqaeda was present in bosnia and herzegovina and its members were mostly veterans of the el mudžahid detachment of the bosnian muslim army of the republic of bosnia and herzegovina three alqaeda operatives carried out the mostar car bombing in 1997 the operatives were closely linked to and financed by the saudi high commission for relief of bosnia and herzegovina founded by thenprince king salman of saudi arabiacitation needed before the 911 attacks and the us invasion of afghanistan westerners who had been recruits at alqaeda training camps were sought after by alqaedas military wing language skills and knowledge of western culture were generally found among recruits from europe such was the case with mohamed atta an egyptian national studying in germany at the time of his training and other members of the hamburg cell osama bin laden and mohammed atef would later designate atta as the ringleader of the 911 hijackers following the attacks western intelligence agencies determined that alqaeda cells operating in europe had aided the hijackers with financing and communications with the central leadership based in afghanistan in 2003 islamists carried out a series of bombings in istanbul killing fiftyseven people and injuring seven hundred seventyfour people were charged by the turkish authorities some had previously met bin laden and though they specifically declined to pledge allegiance to alqaeda they asked for its blessing and help in 2009 three londoners tanvir hussain assad sarwar and ahmed abdullah ali were convicted of conspiring to detonate bombs disguised as soft drinks on seven airplanes bound for canada and the us the mi5 investigation regarding the plot involved more than a year of surveillance work conducted by over two hundred officers british and us officials said the plot\\xa0– unlike many similar homegrown european islamic militant plots\\xa0– was directly linked to alqaeda and guided by senior alqaeda members in pakistan in 2012 russian intelligence indicated that alqaeda had given a call for forest jihad and has been starting massive forest fires as part of a strategy of thousand cuts following yemeni unification in 1990 wahhabi networks began moving missionaries into the country although it is unlikely bin laden or saudi alqaeda were directly involved the personal connections they made would be established over the next decade and used in the uss cole bombing concerns grew over alqaedas group in yemen in iraq alqaeda forces loosely associated with the leadership were embedded in the jamaat altawhid waljihad group commanded by abu musab alzarqawi specializing in suicide operations they have been a key driver of the sunni insurgency although they played a small part in the overall insurgency between 30 and 42 of all suicide bombings which took place in the early years were claimed by zarqawis group reports have indicated that oversights such as the failure to control access to the qaqaa munitions factory in yusufiyah have allowed large quantities of munitions to fall into the hands of alqaida in november 2010 the militant group islamic state of iraq which is linked to alqaeda in iraq threatened to exterminate all iraqi christians alqaeda did not begin training palestinians until the late 1990s large groups such as hamas and palestinian islamic jihad have rejected an alliance with alqaeda fearing that alqaeda will coopt their cells this may have changed recently the israeli security and intelligence services believe alqaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the occupied territories into israel and is waiting for an opportunity to attack as of 2015update saudi arabia qatar and turkey are openly supporting the army of conquest an umbrella rebel group fighting in the syrian civil war against the syrian government that reportedly includes an alqaeda linked alnusra front and another salafi coalition known as ahrar alsham bin laden and ayman alzawahiri consider india to be a part of an alleged crusaderzionisthindu conspiracy against the islamic world according to a 2005 report by the congressional research service bin laden was involved in training militants for jihad in kashmir while living in sudan in the early 1990s by 2001 kashmiri militant group harkatulmujahideen had become a part of the alqaeda coalition according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr alqaeda was thought to have established bases in pakistan administered kashmir in azad kashmir and to some extent in gilgit–baltistan during the 1999 kargil war and continued to operate there with tacit approval of pakistans intelligence services many of the militants active in kashmir were trained in the same madrasahs as taliban and alqaeda fazlur rehman khalil of kashmiri militant group harkatulmujahideen was a signatory of alqaedas 1998 declaration of jihad against america and its allies in a letter to american people 2002 bin laden wrote that one of the reasons he was fighting america was because of its support to india on the kashmir issue in november 2001 kathmandu airport went on high alert after threats that bin laden planned to hijack a plane and crash it into a target in new delhi in 2002 us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld on a trip to delhi suggested that alqaeda was active in kashmir though he did not have any evidence rumsfeld proposed hitech ground sensors along the line of control to prevent militants from infiltrating into indianadministered kashmir\\nan investigation in 2002 found evidence that alqaeda and its affiliates were prospering in pakistanadministered kashmir with tacit approval of pakistans interservices intelligence in 2002 a special team of special air service and delta force was sent into indianadministered kashmir to hunt for bin laden after receiving reports that he was being sheltered by kashmiri militant group harkatulmujahideen which had been responsible for kidnapping western tourists in kashmir in 1995 britains highestranking alqaeda operative rangzieb ahmed had previously fought in kashmir with the group harkatulmujahideen and spent time in indian prison after being captured in kashmir us officials believe alqaeda was helping organize attacks in kashmir in order to provoke conflict between india and pakistan their strategy was to force pakistan to move its troops to the border with india thereby relieving pressure on alqaeda elements hiding in northwestern pakistan in 2006 alqaeda claimed they had established a wing in kashmir however indian army general h s panag argued that the army had ruled out the presence of alqaeda in indianadministered jammu and kashmir panag also said alqaeda had strong ties with kashmiri militant groups lashkaretaiba and jaishemohammed based in pakistan it has been noted that waziristan has become a battlefield for kashmiri militants fighting nato in support of alqaeda and taliban dhiren barot who wrote the army of madinah in kashmir and was an alqaeda operative convicted for involvement in the 2004 financial buildings plot had received training in weapons and explosives at a militant training camp in kashmir maulana masood azhar the founder of kashmiri group jaishemohammed is believed to have met bin laden several times and received funding from him in 2002 jaishemohammed organized the kidnapping and murder of daniel pearl in an operation run in conjunction with alqaeda and funded by bin laden according to american counterterrorism expert bruce riedel alqaeda and taliban were closely involved in the 1999 hijacking of indian airlines flight 814 to kandahar which led to the release of maulana masood azhar and ahmed omar saeed sheikh from an indian prison this hijacking riedel said was rightly described by then indian foreign minister jaswant singh as a dress rehearsal for september 11 attacks bin laden personally welcomed azhar and threw a lavish party in his honor after his release ahmed omar saeed sheikh who had been in prison for his role in the 1994 kidnappings of western tourists in india went on to murder daniel pearl and was sentenced to death in pakistan alqaeda operative rashid rauf who was one of the accused in 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot was related to maulana masood azhar by marriage lashkaretaiba a kashmiri militant group which is thought to be behind 2008 mumbai attacks is also known to have strong ties to senior alqaeda leaders living in pakistan in late 2002 top alqaeda operative abu zubaydah was arrested while being sheltered by lashkaretaiba in a safe house in faisalabad the fbi believes alqaeda and lashkar have been intertwined for a long time while the cia has said that alqaeda funds lashkaretaiba jeanlouis bruguière told reuters in 2009 that lashkaretaiba is no longer a pakistani movement with only a kashmir political or military agenda lashkaretaiba is a member of alqaeda in a video released in 2008 americanborn senior alqaeda operative adam yahiye gadahn said that victory in kashmir has been delayed for years it is the liberation of the jihad there from this interference which allah willing will be the first step towards victory over the hindu occupiers of that islam land in september 2009 a us drone strike reportedly killed ilyas kashmiri who was the chief of harkatuljihad alislami a kashmiri militant group associated with alqaeda kashmiri was described by bruce riedel as a prominent alqaeda member while others have described him as head of military operations for alqaeda kashmiri was also charged by the us in a plot against jyllandsposten the danish newspaper which was at the center of jyllandsposten muhammad cartoons controversy us officials also believe that kashmiri was involved in the camp chapman attack against the cia in january 2010 indian authorities notified britain of an alqaeda plot to hijack an indian airlines or air india plane and crash it into a british city this information was uncovered from interrogation of amjad khwaja an operative of harkatuljihad alislami who had been arrested in india in january 2010 us defense secretary robert gates while on a visit to pakistan said that alqaeda was seeking to destabilize the region and planning to provoke a nuclear war between india and pakistan alqaeda and its successors have migrated online to escape detection in an atmosphere of increased international vigilance the groups use of the internet has grown more sophisticated with online activities that include financing recruitment networking mobilization publicity and information dissemination gathering and sharing abu ayyub almasris alqaeda movement in iraq regularly releases short videos glorifying the activity of jihadist suicide bombers in addition both before and after the death of abu musab alzarqawi the former leader of alqaeda in iraq the umbrella organization to which alqaeda in iraq belongs the mujahideen shura council has a regular presence on the web the range of multimedia content includes guerrilla training clips stills of victims about to be murdered testimonials of suicide bombers and videos that show participation in jihad through stylized portraits of mosques and musical scores a website associated with alqaeda posted a video of captured american entrepreneur nick berg being decapitated in iraq other decapitation videos and pictures including those of paul johnson kim sunil and daniel pearl were first posted on jihadist websitescitation needed in december 2004 an audio message claiming to be from bin laden was posted directly to a website rather than sending a copy to al jazeera as he had done in the past alqaeda turned to the internet for release of its videos in order to be certain they would be available unedited rather than risk the possibility of al jazeera editing out anything critical of the saudi royal family alnedacom and jehadnet were perhaps the most significant alqaeda websites alneda was initially taken down by american jon messner but the operators resisted by shifting the site to various servers and strategically shifting contentcitation needed the us government charged a british information technology specialist babar ahmad with terrorist offences related to his operating a network of englishlanguage alqaeda websites such as azzamcom he was convicted and sentenced to 121⁄2 years in prison in 2007 alqaeda released mujahedeen secrets encryption software used for online and cellular communications a later version mujahideen secrets 2 was released in 2008 alqaeda is believed to be operating a clandestine aviation network including several boeing 727 aircraft turboprops and executive jets according to a 2010 reuters story based on a us department of homeland security report the story said alqaeda is possibly using aircraft to transport drugs and weapons from south america to various unstable countries in west africa a boeing 727 can carry up to ten tons of cargo the drugs eventually are smuggled to europe for distribution and sale and the weapons are used in conflicts in africa and possibly elsewhere gunmen with links to alqaeda have been increasingly kidnapping europeans for ransom the profits from the drug and weapon sales and kidnappings can in turn fund more militant activities the following is a list of military conflicts in which alqaeda and its direct affiliates have taken part militarily islamic state of iraq experts debate the notion that the alqaeda attacks were an indirect consequence of the american cias operation cyclone program to help the afghan mujahideen robin cook british foreign secretary from 1997 to 2001 has written that alqaeda and bin laden were a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies and that alqaida literally the database was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the cia to defeat the russians munir akram permanent representative of pakistan to the united nations from 2002 to 2008 wrote in a letter published in the new york times on january 19 2008 the strategy to support the afghans against soviet military intervention was evolved by several intelligence agencies including the cia and interservices intelligence or isi after the soviet withdrawal the western powers walked away from the region leaving behind 40000 militants imported from several countries to wage the antisoviet jihad pakistan was left to face the blowback of extremism drugs and guns cnn journalist peter bergen pakistani isi brigadier mohammad yousaf and cia operatives involved in the afghan program such as vincent cannistraro deny that the cia or other american officials had contact with the foreign mujahideen or bin laden or that they armed trained coached or indoctrinated them in his 2004 book ghost wars steve coll writes that the cia had contemplated providing direct support to the foreign mujahideen but that the idea never moved beyond discussions bergen and otherswho else argue that there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamiliar with the local language customs or lay of the land since there were a quarter of a million local afghans willing to fightfailed verification bergen further argues that foreign mujahideen had no need for american funds since they received several million dollars per year from internal sources lastly he argues that americans could not have trained the foreign mujahideen because pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of them to operate in pakistan and none in afghanistan and the afghan arabs were almost invariably militant islamists reflexively hostile to westerners whether or not the westerners were helping the muslim afghans according to bergen who conducted the first television interview with bin laden in 1997 the idea that the cia funded bin laden or trained bin laden\\xa0 is a folk myth theres no evidence of this\\xa0 bin laden had his own money he was antiamerican and he was operating secretly and independently\\xa0 the real story here is the cia didnt really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him jason burke also wrote some of the 500 million the cia poured into afghanistan reached alzawahiris group alzawahiri has become a close aide of bin laden\\xa0 bin laden was only loosely connected with the hezbiislami faction of the mujahideen led by gulbuddin hekmatyar serving under another hezbiislami commander known as engineer machmud however bin ladens office of services set up to recruit overseas for the war received some us cash anders behring breivik the perpetrator of the 2011 norway attacks was inspired by alqaeda calling it the most successful revolutionary movement in the world while admitting different aims he sought to create a european version of alqaida the appropriate response to offshoots is a subject of debate a journalist reported in 2012 that a senior us military planner had asked should we resort to drones and special operations raids every time some group raises the black banner of al qaeda how long can we continue to chase offshoots of offshoots around the world islamic extremism dates back to the early history of islam with the emergence of the kharijites in the 7th century ce from their essentially political position the kharijites developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream sunni and shiʿa muslims the original schism between kharijites sunnis and shiʿas among muslims was disputed over the political and religious succession to the guidance of the muslim community ummah after the death of the islamic prophet muhammad shiʿas believe ali ibn abi talib is the true successor to muhammad while sunnis consider abu bakr to hold that position the kharijites broke away from both the shiʿas and the sunnis during the first fitna the first islamic civil war they were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to takfīr excommunication whereby they declared both sunni and shiʿa muslims to be either infidels kuffār or false muslims munāfiḳūn and therefore deemed them worthy of death for their perceived apostasy ridda according to a number of sources a wave of revulsion has been expressed against alqaeda and its affiliates by religious scholars former fighters and militants who are alarmed by alqaedas takfir and its killing of muslims in muslim countries especially in iraq noman benotman a former militant member of the libyan islamic fighting group lifg went public with an open letter of criticism to ayman alzawahiri in november 2007 after persuading the imprisoned senior leaders of his former group to enter into peace negotiations with the libyan regime while ayman alzawahiri announced the affiliation of the group with alqaeda in november 2007 the libyan government released 90 members of the group from prison several months after they were said to have renounced violence in 2007 on the anniversary of the september 11 attacks the saudi sheikh salman alouda delivered a personal rebuke to bin laden alouda a religious scholar and one of the fathers of the sahwa the fundamentalist awakening movement that swept through saudi arabia in the 1980s is a widely respected critic of jihadismcitation needed alouda addressed alqaedas leader on television asking him my brother osama how much blood has been spilt how many innocent people children elderly and women have been killed\\xa0 in the name of alqaeda will you be happy to meet god almighty carrying the burden of these hundreds of thousands or millions of victims on your back according to pew polls support for alqaeda had dropped in the muslim world in the years before 2008 support of suicide bombings in indonesia lebanon and bangladesh dropped by half or more in the last five yearswhen in saudi arabia only ten percent had a favorable view of alqaeda according to a december 2017 poll by terror free tomorrow a washingtonbased think tank in 2007 the imprisoned sayyed imam alsharif an influential afghan arab ideological godfather of alqaeda and former supporter of takfir withdrew his support from alqaeda with a book wathiqat tarshid alaml aljihadi fi misr walalam english rationalizing jihad in egypt and the world although once associated with alqaeda in september 2009 lifg completed a new code for jihad a 417page religious document entitled corrective studies given its credibility and the fact that several other prominent jihadists in the middle east have turned against alqaeda the lifgs reversal may be an important step toward staunching alqaedas recruitment bilal abdul kareem an american journalist based in syria created a documentary about alshabab alqaedas affiliate in somalia the documentary included interviews with former members of the group who stated their reasons for leaving alshabab the members made accusations of segregation lack of religious awareness and internal corruption and favoritism in response to kareem the global islamic media front condemned kareem called him a liar and denied the accusations from the former fighters in mid2014 after the islamic state of iraq and the levant declared that they had restored the caliphate an audio statement was released by the thenspokesman of the group abu muhammad aladnani claiming that the legality of all emirates groups states and organizations becomes null by the expansion of the caliphates authority the speech included a religious refutation of alqaeda for being too lenient regarding shiites and their refusal to recognize the authority abu bakr albaghdadi aladnani specifically noting it is not suitable for a state to give allegiance to an organization he also recalled a past instance in which osama bin laden called on alqaeda members and supporters to give allegiance to abu omar albaghdadi when the group was still solely operating in iraq as the islamic state of iraq and condemned ayman alzawahiri for not making this same claim for abu bakr albaghdadi zawahiri was encouraging factionalism and division between former allies of isil such as the alnusra front the september 11 attacks commonly known as 911d were four coordinated islamist suicide terrorist attacks carried out by alqaeda against the united states in 2001 that morning 19 terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners scheduled to travel from the new england and midatlantic regions of the east coast to california the hijackers crashed the first two planes into the twin towers of the world trade center in new york city two of the worlds five tallest buildings at the time and aimed the next two flights toward targets in or near washington dc in an attack on the nations capital the third team succeeded in crashing into the pentagon the headquarters of the us department of defense in arlington county virginia while the fourth plane crashed in rural pennsylvania following a passenger revolt the attacks killed nearly 3000 people and instigated the multidecade global war on terror the first impact was that of american airlines flight 11 which crashed into the north tower of the world trade center complex in lower manhattan at 846 ame sixteen minutes later at 903f the world trade centers south tower was hit by united airlines flight 175 both 110story skyscrapers collapsed within an hour and fortyone minutesg bringing about the destruction of the remaining five structures in the wtc complex and several other nearby buildings a third flight american airlines flight 77 crashed into the pentagon at 937 am causing a partial collapse the fourth and final flight united airlines flight 93 flew in the direction of the capital alerted to the previous attacks the passengers retaliated in an attempt to take control of the aircraft forcing the hijackers to crash the plane in a stonycreek township field near indian lake and shanksville at 1003 am investigators determined that flight 93s target was either the united states capitol or the white house within hours of the attacks the central intelligence agency had determined that alqaeda was responsible the united states formally responded by launching the war on terror and invading afghanistan to depose the taliban which rejected the conditions of us terms to expel alqaeda from afghanistan and extradite its leaders the uss invocation of article 5 of the north atlantic treaty—its only usage to date—called upon allies to fight alqaeda as us and nato invasion forces swept through afghanistan alqaeda leader osama bin laden disappeared into the white mountains eluding captivity by western forces although bin laden initially denied any involvement in 2004 he formally claimed responsibility for the attacks alqaedas cited motivations included us support of israel the presence of us military bases in saudi arabia and sanctions against iraq the nearly decadelong manhunt for bin laden concluded on may 2 2011 when he was killed during a us military raid after being tracked down to his compound in abbottabad pakistan the war in afghanistan continued for another eight years until the agreement was made in february 2020 for american and nato troops to withdraw from the country and the last members of the us armed forces left the region on august 30 2021 resulting in the return to power of the taliban not including the hijackers the attacks killed 2977 people injured thousands more and gave rise to substantial longterm health consequences while also causing at least 10\\xa0billion in infrastructure and property damage it remains the deadliest terrorist act in human history as well as the single deadliest incident for both firefighters and law enforcement personnel in the history of the united states causing the deaths of 343 and 72 members respectively the loss of life stemming from the impact of flight 11 secured its place as the most lethal plane crash in aviation history followed by the death toll incurred by flight 175 the destruction of the world trade center and its environs seriously harmed the us economy and induced global market shocks many other countries strengthened antiterrorism legislation and expanded their powers of law enforcement and intelligence agencies cleanup of the world trade center site colloquially ground zero took eight months and was completed in may 2002 while the pentagon was repaired within a year after delays in the design of a replacement complex construction of the one world trade center began in november 2006 it opened in november 2014 memorials to the attacks include the national september 11 memorial  museum in new york city the pentagon memorial in arlington county virginia and the flight 93 national memorial at the pennsylvania crash site the origins of alqaeda can be traced to 1979 when the soviet union invaded afghanistan soon after the invasion osama bin laden traveled to afghanistan and helped organize arab mujahideen the afghan arabs to resist the communist invaders soviets until their exit from the country in 1989 during that time bin laden together with abdullah azzam formed the maktab alkhidamat mak in 1984 an organization to support arab mujahideen who came to join the jihad in afghanistan the us central intelligence agency cia funneled several billion dollars worth of weapons to the indigenous afghan mujahideen resistance a portion of which bled to the arab volunteers however no direct evidence of us aid to bin laden or any of his affiliates was ever uncovered in 1996 bin laden issued his first fatwā calling for american soldiers to leave saudi arabia in a second 1998 fatwā bin laden outlined his objections to american foreign policy with respect to the state of israel as well as the continued presence of american troops in saudi arabia after the gulf war a subscriber to the athari literalist and wahhabi school of islamic theology bin laden used islamic quran texts to exhort muslims to attack americans until the stated grievances were reversed according to bin laden muslim legal scholars had throughout islamic history unanimously agreed that the jihad is an individual duty if the enemy destroys the muslim countries bin laden orchestrated the attacks he initially denied involvement but later recanted his false statements al jazeera broadcast a statement by him on september 16 2001 i stress that i have not carried out this act which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation in november 2001 us forces recovered a videotape from a destroyed house in jalalabad afghanistan in the video bin laden talking to khaled alharbi admitted foreknowledge of the attacks on december 27 2001 a second video of bin laden was released in which he stopping short of admitting responsibility for the attacks said it has become clear that the west in general and america in particular have an unspeakable hatred for islam\\xa0 it is the hatred of crusaders terrorism against america deserves to be praised because it was a response to injustice aimed at forcing america to stop its support for israel which kills our people\\xa0 we say that the end of the united states is imminent whether bin laden or his followers are alive or dead for the awakening of the muslim ummah nation has occurred\\xa0 it is important to hit the economy of the united states which is the base of its military powerif the economy is hit they will become reoccupied shortly before the 2004 us presidential election bin laden used a taped statement to publicly acknowledge alqaedas involvement in the attacks he admitted his direct link to the attacks and said they were carried out because the events that affected my soul in a direct way started in 1982 when america permitted the israelis to invade lebanon and the american sixth fleet helped them in that this bombardment began and many were killed and injured and others were terrorised and displaced i couldnt forget those moving scenes blood and severed limbs women and children sprawled everywhere houses destroyed along with their occupants and high rises demolished over their residents rockets raining down on our home without mercyand as i looked at those demolished towers in lebanon it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in america in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children and that day it was confirmed to me that oppression and the intentional killing of innocent women and children is a deliberate american policy destruction is freedom and democracy while resistance is terrorism and intolerance bin laden said that he had personally directed his followers to attack the world trade center and the pentagon another video obtained by al jazeera in september 2006 showed bin laden with one of the attacks chief planners ramzi bin alshibh as well as hijackers hamza alghamdi and wail alshehri amidst making preparations for the attacks the us never formally indicted bin laden for the september 11 attacks but he was on the fbis most wanted list for the bombings of the us embassies in dar es salaam tanzania and nairobi kenya after a 10year manhunt us president barack obama announced on may 1 2011 that us special forces had killed bin laden earlier that dayh in his compound in abbottabad pakistan journalist yosri fouda of the arabic television channel al jazeera reported that in april 2002 alqaeda member khalid sheikh mohammed admitted his involvement in the attacks along with ramzi bin alshibh the 2004 911 commission report determined that the animosity towards the united states felt by mohammed the principal architect of the 911 attacks stemmed from his violent disagreement with us foreign policy favoring israel mohammed was also an adviser and financier of the 1993 world trade center bombing and the uncle of ramzi yousef the lead bomber in that attack in late 1994 mohammed and yousef moved on to plan a new terrorist attack called the bojinka plot planned for january 1995 despite a failure and yousefs capture by us forces the following month the bojinka plot would highly influence the later 911 attacks mohammed was arrested on march 1 2003 in rawalpindi pakistan by pakistani security officials working with the cia he was then held at multiple cia secret prisons and guantanamo bay where he was interrogated and tortured with methods including waterboarding during us hearings at guantanamo bay in march 2007 mohammed again confessed his responsibility for the attacks stating he was responsible for the 911 operation from a to z and that his statement was not made under duress charges were announced by brigadier general thomas w hartmann on february 11 2008 at a press conference hosted by the pentagon in august 2023 it was reported that the biden administration is considering a plea deal that would eliminate the death penalty as of october\\xa02023update the trial against mohammed and his coconspirators walid bin attash ramzi bin alshibh ammar albaluchi and mustafa ahmad al hawsawi remains unresolved in substitution for testimony of khalid sheikh mohammed from the trial of zacarias moussaoui five people are identified as having been completely aware of the operations details they are bin laden khalid sheikh mohammed ramzi bin alshibh abu turab alurduni and mohammed atef to date only peripheral figures have been tried or convicted for the attacks in 2003 mustafa alhawsawi and abd alaziz ali were arrested and transferred to us custody both would later be accused of providing money and travel assistance to the hijackers in 2006 zacarias moussaoui who some originally suspected might have been the assigned twentieth hijacker was convicted for the lesser role of conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism and air piracy he was sentenced to life in prison without parole in the united states mounir elmotassadeq an associate of the hamburgbased hijackers served 15 years in germany for his role in helping the hijackers prepare for the attacks he was released in october 2018 and deported to morocco on september 26 2005 the spanish high court sentenced abu dahdah to 27 years in prison for conspiracy on the 911 attacks and being a member of the terrorist organization alqaeda on february 16 2006 the spanish supreme court reduced abu dahdahs penalty to 12 years because it considered that his participation in the conspiracy was not proven the hamburg cell in germany included radical islamists who eventually came to be key operatives in the 911 attacks mohamed atta marwan alshehhi ziad jarrah ramzi bin alshibh and said bahaji were all members of alqaedas hamburg cell osama bin ladens declaration of a holy war against the united states and a 1998 fatwā signed by bin laden and others calling for the killing of americans are seen by investigators as evidence of his motivation in bin ladens november 2002 letter to america he explicitly stated that alqaedas motives for the attacks included by july with word spreading of a coming attack a schism emerged among the senior leadership of al qaeda several senior members reportedly agreed with mullah omar those who reportedly sided with bin ladin included atef sulayman abu ghayth and ksm but those said to have opposed him were weighty figures in the organizationincluding abu hafs the mauritanian sheikh saeed al masri and sayf al adl one senior al qaeda operative claims to recall bin ladin arguing that attacks against the united states needed to be carried out immediately to support insurgency in the israelioccupied territories and protest the presence of us forces in saudi arabia — 911 commission report pp 251 after the attacks bin laden and ayman alzawahiri released additional videotapes and audio recordings some of which repeated those reasons for the attacks two particularly important publications were bin ladens 2002 letter to america and a 2004 videotape by bin laden bin laden interpreted muhammad as having banned the permanent presence of infidels in arabia in 1996 bin laden issued a fatwā calling for american troops to leave saudi arabia in 1998 alqaeda wrote for over seven years the united states has been occupying the lands of islam in the holiest of places the arabian peninsula plundering its riches dictating to its rulers humiliating its people terrorizing its neighbors and turning its bases in the peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight the neighboring muslim peoples in a december 1999 interview bin laden said he felt that americans were too near to mecca and considered this a provocation to the entire muslim world one analysis of suicide terrorism suggested that without us troops in saudi arabia alqaeda likely would not have been able to get people to commit to suicide missions in the 1998 fatwā alqaeda identified the iraq sanctions as a reason to kill americans condemning the protracted blockade among other actions that constitute a declaration of war against allah his messenger and muslims the fatwā declared that the ruling to kill the americans and their allies\\xa0– civilians and military\\xa0– is an individual duty for every muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it in order to liberate the alaqsa mosque and the holy mosque of mecca from their grip and in order for their the americans armies to move out of all the lands of islam defeated and unable to threaten any muslim in 2004 bin laden claimed that the idea of destroying the towers had first occurred to him in 1982 when he witnessed israels bombardment of highrise apartment buildings during the 1982 lebanon war some analysts including political scientists john mearsheimer and stephen walt also claimed that us support of israel was one motive for the attacks in 2004 and 2010 bin laden again connected the september 11 attacks with us support of israel although most of the letter expressed bin ladens disdain for president bush and bin ladens hope to destroy and bankrupt the us other motives have been suggested in addition to those stated by bin laden and alqaeda some authors suggested the humiliation that resulted from the islamic world falling behind the western world\\xa0– this discrepancy was rendered especially visible by globalization and a desire to provoke the us into a broader war against the islamic world in the hope of motivating more allies to support alqaeda similarly others have argued that 911 was a strategic move with the objective of provoking america into a war that would incite a panislamic revolution documents seized during the 2011 operation that killed bin laden included a few notes handwritten by bin laden in september 2002 with the heading the birth of the idea of september 11 in these notes he describes how he was inspired by the crash of egyptair flight 990 on october 31 1999 which was deliberately crashed by copilot gameel albatouti this is how the idea of 911 was conceived and developed in my head and that is when we began the planning bin laden continued adding that no one but abu hafs and abu alkhair knew about it at the time the 911 commission report identified khalid sheikh mohammed as the architect of 911 but he is not mentioned in bin ladens notes the attacks were conceived by khalid sheikh mohammed who first presented it to osama bin laden in 1996 at that time bin laden and alqaeda were in a period of transition having just relocated back to afghanistan from sudan the 1998 african embassy bombings and bin ladens february 1998 fatwā marked a turning point of alqaedas terrorist operation as bin laden became intent on attacking the united states in late 1998 or early 1999 bin laden gave approval for mohammed to go forward with organizing the plot mohammed bin laden and mohammed atef the deputy of bin laden held a series of meetings in early 1999 atef provided operational support including target selections and helping arrange travel for the hijackers bin laden overruled mohammed rejecting potential targets such as the us bank tower in los angeles for lack of time bin laden provided leadership and financial support and was involved in selecting participants he initially selected nawaf alhazmi and khalid almihdhar both experienced jihadists who had fought in bosnia hazmi and mihdhar arrived in the united states in midjanuary 2000 in early 2000 hazmi and mihdhar took flying lessons in san diego california both spoke little english performed poorly in flying lessons and eventually served as secondary muscle hijackers in late 1999 a group of men from hamburg germany arrived in afghanistan the group included mohamed atta marwan alshehhi ziad jarrah and ramzi bin alshibh bin laden selected these men because they were educated could speak english and had experience living in the west new recruits were routinely screened for special skills and alqaeda leaders consequently discovered that hani hanjour already had a commercial pilots license mohammed later said that he helped the hijackers blend in by teaching them how to order food in restaurants and dress in western clothing hanjour arrived in san diego on december 8 2000 joining hazmi\\u200a6–7\\u200a they soon left for arizona where hanjour took refresher training\\u200a7\\u200a marwan alshehhi arrived at the end of may 2000 while atta arrived on june 3 2000 and jarrah arrived on june 27 2000\\u200a6\\u200a bin alshibh applied several times for a visa to the united states but as a yemeni he was rejected out of concerns he would overstay his visa\\u200a4\\u200a14\\u200a bin alshibh stayed in hamburg providing coordination between atta and mohammed\\u200a16\\u200a the three hamburg cell members all took pilot training in south florida at huffman aviation\\u200a6 in the spring of 2001 the secondary hijackers began arriving in the united states in july 2001 atta met with bin alshibh in tarragona catalonia spain where they coordinated details of the plot including final target selection bin alshibh also passed along bin ladens wish for the attacks to be carried out as soon as possible some of the hijackers received passports from corrupt saudi officials who were family members or used fraudulent passports to gain entry there have been a few theories that 911 was selected by the hijackers as the date of the attack because of its resemblance to 911 the phone number used to report emergencies in the united states however lawrence wright wrote that the hijackers chose the date when john iii sobieski the king of poland and grand duke of lithuania began the battle that turned back the ottoman empires muslim armies that were attempting to capture vienna presentday capital of austria on 11 september 1683 during 1683 vienna was the seat of the holy roman empire and habsburg monarchy both major powers in europe at the time for osama bin laden this was a date when the west gained some dominance over islam and by attacking on this date he hoped to make a step in islam winning the war for worldwide power and influence in late 1999 alqaeda associate walid bin attash khallad contacted mihdhar telling him to meet him in kuala lumpur malaysia hazmi and abu bara al yemeni would also be in attendance the nsa intercepted a telephone call mentioning the meeting mihdhar and the name nawaf hazmi while the agency feared something nefarious might be afoot it took no further action the cia had already been alerted by saudi intelligence about the status of mihdhar and hazmi as alqaeda members and a cia team broke into mihdhars dubai hotel room and discovered that mihdhar had a us visa while alec station alerted intelligence agencies worldwide about this fact it did not share this information with the fbi the malaysian special branch observed the january 5 2000 meeting of the two alqaeda members and informed the cia that mihdhar hazmi and khallad were flying to bangkok but the cia never notified other agencies of this nor did it ask the state department to put mihdhar on its watchlist an fbi liaison to alec station asked permission to inform the fbi of the meeting but was told this is not a matter for the fbi by late june senior counterterrorism official richard clarke and cia director george tenet were convinced that a major series of attacks was about to come although the cia believed the attacks would likely occur in saudi arabia or israel in early july clarke put domestic agencies on full alert telling them something really spectacular is going to happen here soon he asked the fbi and the state department to alert the embassies and police departments and the defense department to go to threat condition delta clarke later wrote somewhere in cia there was information that two known al qaeda terrorists had come into the united states somewhere in fbi there was information that strange things had been going on at flight schools in the united states\\xa0 they had specific information about individual terrorists from which one could have deduced what was about to happen none of that information got to me or the white house on july 13 tom wilshire a cia agent assigned to the fbis international terrorism division emailed his superiors at the cias counterterrorism center ctc requesting permission to inform the fbi that hazmi was in the country and that mihdhar had a us visa the cia never responded the same day in july margarette gillespie an fbi analyst working in the ctc was told to review material about the malaysia meeting she was not told of the participants presence in the us the cia gave gillespie surveillance photos of mihdhar and hazmi from the meeting to show to fbi counterterrorism but did not tell her their significance the intelink database informed her not to share intelligence material on the meeting with criminal investigators when shown the photos the fbi were refused more details on their significance and they were not given mihdhars date of birth nor passport number in late august 2001 gillespie told the ins the state department the customs service and the fbi to put hazmi and mihdhar on their watchlists but the fbi was prohibited from using criminal agents in searching for the duo hindering their efforts also in july a phoenixbased fbi agent sent a message to fbi headquarters alec station and fbi agents in new york alerting them to the possibility of a coordinated effort by osama bin laden to send students to the united states to attend civil aviation universities and colleges the agent kenneth williams suggested the need to interview all flight school managers and identify all arab students seeking flight training in july jordan alerted the us that alqaeda was planning an attack on the us months later jordan notified the us that the attacks codename was the big wedding and that it involved airplanes on august 6 2001 the cias presidential daily brief pdb designated for the president only was entitled bin ladin determined to strike in us the memo noted that fbi information indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks in midaugust one minnesota flight school alerted the fbi about zacarias moussaoui who had asked suspicious questions the fbi found that moussaoui was a radical who had traveled to pakistan and the ins arrested him for overstaying his french visa their request to search his laptop was denied by fbi headquarters due to the lack of probable cause the failures in intelligencesharing were attributed to 1995 justice department policies limiting intelligence sharing combined with cia and nsa reluctance to reveal sensitive sources and methods such as tapped phones testifying before the 911 commission in april 2004 then – attorney general john ashcroft recalled that the single greatest structural cause for the september 11th problem was the wall that segregated or separated criminal investigators and intelligence agents clarke also wrote there were failures to get information to the right place at the right time early on the morning of september 11 2001 nineteen hijackers took control of four commercial airliners two boeing 757s and two boeing 767s en route to california three of them headed to lax in los angeles and one to sfo in san francisco after takeoffs from logan international airport in boston massachusetts newark liberty international airport in newark new jersey and washington dulles international airport in loudoun and fairfax counties in virginia large planes with long coasttocoast flights were selected for hijacking because they would have more fuel the four flights were media coverage was extensive during the attacks and aftermath beginning moments after the first crash into the world trade center  eastern daylight time utc−0400† excluding hijackers§ including emergency workers‡ including hijackers at 759\\xa0am american airlines flight 11 took off from logan international airport in boston fifteen minutes into the flight five hijackers armed with boxcutters took over the plane injuring at least three people and possibly killing one before forcing their way into the cockpit the terrorists also displayed an apparent explosive device in order to frighten the hostages into submission while additionally spraying mace into the cabin to further hinder any efforts to resist back at logan united airlines flight 175 took off at 814\\xa0am approximately the same time as flight 11s hijacking hundreds of miles southwest at dulles international airport in fairfax and loudoun counties virginia american airlines flight 77 left the runway at 820\\xa0am flight 175s journey proceeded normally for 28 minutes until 842\\xa0am when another group of five hijacked the plane murdering both pilots and stabbing several crew members before assuming control of the aircraft as was the case with flight 11 the hijackers used bomb threats to instill fear into the passengers and crew and sprayed chemical weapons to disable any opposition concurrently united airlines flight 93 departed from newark international airport in new jersey originally scheduled to pull away from the gate at 800\\xa0am the plane was running 42 minutes late at 846\\xa0am flight 11 became the first plane to reach its target when it was deliberately crashed into the north face of the world trade centers north tower 1 wtc although the initial presumption by many was that this was merely an accident at 851\\xa0am shortly after the north tower was struck and only minutes following the hijacking of flight 175 american airlines flight 77 was also taken over by another group of five who forcibly entered the cockpit 31 minutes after takeoff although the hijackers were equipped with knives there were no reports of anyone on board actually being stabbed unlike the first two planes nor did the two people who made phone calls mention the use of mace or a bomb threat of any kind seventeen minutes after the first plane crashed into the north tower flight 175 was flown into the south towers southern facade 2\\xa0wtc at 903\\xa0amf instantly proving to the entire world that the first crash was not an accident but that a terrorist attack was underway after waiting 46 minutes to make their move—a holdup that proved disastrous for the terrorists when combined with the delayed takeoff from the runway—four men aboard flight 93 struck suddenly killing at least one passenger before storming the cockpit and seizing control of the plane at 928\\xa0am turning the plane eastbound and setting course for washington dc much like their counterparts on the first two flights the fourth team also used bomb threats to get their way and again filled the cabin with mace nine minutes after flight 93s hijacking flight 77 was crashed into the west side of the pentagon because of the two delays the passengers and crew of flight 93 had time to be made aware of the previous attacks through phone calls to the ground knowing their lives were forfeited rendered the bomb threat moot and an uprising was hastily organized in the hopes of taking control of the aircraft with an assault on the hijackers being launched at 957\\xa0am within minutes they had fought their way to the front of the cabin and began breaking down the cockpit door fearing their captives would gain the upper hand the hijackers rolled the plane and pitched it into a nosedive crashing into a field near shanksville pennsylvania southeast of pittsburgh at 1003\\xa0am the plane was around twenty minutes away from reaching dc at the time of the crash and its target is believed to have been either the capitol building or the white house some passengers and crew members who called from the aircraft using the cabin air phone service and mobile phones provided details several hijackers were aboard each plane they used mace tear gas or pepper spray to overcome attendants and some people aboard had been stabbed reports indicated hijackers stabbed and killed pilots flight attendants and one or more passengers according to the 911 commissions final report the hijackers had recently purchased multifunction hand tools and assorted leathermantype utility knives with locking blades which were not forbidden to passengers at the time but were not found among the possessions left behind by the hijackers a flight attendant on flight 11 a passenger on flight 175 and passengers on flight 93 said the hijackers had bombs but one of the passengers said he thought the bombs were fake the fbi found no traces of explosives at the crash sites and the 911 commission concluded that the bombs were probably fake on at least two of the hijacked flights – american 11 and united 93 – the terrorists tried to ensure nobody would resist by claiming over the pa system that they were taking hostages and were returning to the airport to have a ransom demand met an obvious attempt to deceive those onboard into staying put by way of a false hope both of these attempts fell on deaf ears however as the hijacker pilots in both instances mohamed atta and ziad jarrah respectively keyed the wrong switch and mistakenly transmitted their messages to atc instead of the people on the plane as intended in the process tipping off the flight controllers that the planes had been hijacked three buildings in the world trade center collapsed due to fireinduced structural failure although the south tower was struck 17 minutes after the north tower the planes impact zone was far lower at a much faster speed and into a corner with the unevenlybalanced additional structural weight causing it to collapse first at 959\\xa0am\\u200a80\\u200a\\u200a322\\u200a having burned

international civilian aircraft were either turned back or redirected to airports in canada or mexico and were banned from landing on united states territory for three days the attacks created widespread confusion among news organizations and air traffic controllers among the unconfirmed and often contradictory news reports aired throughout the day one of the most prevalent said a car bomb had been detonated at the us state departments headquarters in washington dc another jet delta air lines flight 1989 was suspected of having been hijacked but the aircraft responded to controllers and landed safely in cleveland ohio in an april 2002 interview khalid sheikh mohammed and ramzi bin alshibh who are believed to have organized the attacks said flight 93s intended target was the united states capitol not the white house during the planning stage of the attacks mohamed atta flight 11s hijacker and pilot thought the white house might be too tough a target and sought an assessment from hani hanjour who hijacked and piloted flight 77 mohammed said alqaeda initially planned to target nuclear installations rather than the world trade center and the pentagon but decided against it fearing things could get out of control final decisions on targets according to mohammed were left in the hands of the pilots if any pilot could not reach his intended target he was to crash the plane in new york city the attack on the world trade centers north tower singlehandedlyk made 911 the deadliest act of terrorism in world history our world in data described it as the deadliest terrorist

visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact in the north tower between 1344 and 1402 people were at above or one floor below the point of impact and all died hundreds were killed instantly the moment the plane struck the estimated 800 people who survived the impact were trapped and died in the fires or from smoke inhalation fell or jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames or were killed in the buildings collapse the destruction of all three staircases in the north tower when flight 11 hit made it impossible for anyone from the impact zone upward to escape 107 people not trapped by the impact died when the plane struck between floors 93 and 99 the 92nd floor was also rendered inescapable when the crash severed all elevator shafts while debris falling from the impact zone blocked the stairwells ensuring the deaths of all 69 workers on the final floor below the point of impact in the south tower around 600 people were on or above the 77th floor when flight 175 struck and few survived as with the north tower hundreds were killed at the moment of impact however unlike those in the north tower the estimated 300 survivors of the crash were

floors above to escape new york city 911 operators who received calls from people inside the tower were not well informed of the situation as it rapidly unfolded and as a result told callers not to descend the tower on their own in total 630 people died in the south tower fewer than half the number killed in the north tower of the 100–200 people witnessed jumping or falling to their deaths that morning only three recorded sightings were from the south tower\\u200a86\\u200a casualties in the south tower were significantly reduced because some occupants decided to leave the building immediately following the first crash and because eric eisenberg an executive at aon insurance made the decision to evacuate the floors occupied by aon floors 92 and 98–105 in the moments following the impact of flight 11 the 17minute gap allowed over 900 of the 1100 aon employees present onsite to evacuate from above the 77th floor before the south tower was struck eisenberg was among the nearly 200 who did not escape similar preimpact evacuations were carried out by companies such as fiduciary trust csc and euro brokers all of whom had offices on floors above the point of impact the failure to order a full evacuation of the south tower after the first plane crash into the north tower was described by usa today as one of the days great tragedies as exemplified in the photograph the falling man more than 200 people fell to their deaths from the burning towers most of whom were forced to jump in order to escape the extreme heat fire and smoke some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in the hope of helicopter rescue but the roof access doors were locked no plan existed for helicopter rescues and the combination of roof equipment

10000 unidentified bone and tissue fragments that cannot be matched to the list of the dead bone fragments were still being found in 2006 by workers who were preparing to demolish the damaged deutsche bank building in 2010 a team of anthropologists and archaeologists searched for human remains and personal items at the fresh kills landfill where 72 more human remains were recovered bringing the total found to 1845 dna profiling continues in an attempt to identify additional victims the remains are being held in storage in memorial park outside the new york city medical examiners facilities it was expected that the remains would be moved in 2013 to a repository behind a wall at the 911 museumneeds update in july 2011 a team of scientists at the office of chief medical examiner continued

including 90 west street and the verizon building suffered major damage but have been restored world financial center buildings one liberty plaza the millenium hilton and 90 church street had moderate damage and have since been restored communications equipment on top of the north tower was also destroyed with only wcbstv maintaining a backup transmitter on the empire state building but media stations were quickly able to reroute the signals and resume their broadcasts the path train systems world trade center station was located under the complex as a result the entire station was demolished completely when the towers collapsed and the tunnels leading to exchange place station in jersey city new jersey were flooded with water the station was rebuilt as the 4\\xa0billion world trade center transportation hub which reopened in march 2015 the cortlandt street station on the new york city subways irt broadway–seventh avenue line was also in close proximity to the world trade

aviation unit the nypd aviation unit assessed the situation and decided that helicopter rescues from the towers were not feasible numerous police officers of the port authority police department\\xa0papd also participated in rescue efforts once on the scene the fdny the nypd and the papd did not coordinate efforts and performed redundant searches for civilians as conditions deteriorated the nypd aviation unit relayed information to police commanders who issued orders for its personnel to evacuate the towers most nypd officers were able to safely evacuate before the buildings collapsed with separate command posts set up and incompatible radio communications between the agencies warnings were not passed along to fdny commanders after the first tower collapsed fdny commanders issued evacuation warnings due to technical difficulties with malfunctioning radio repeater systems many firefighters never heard the evacuation orders 911 dispatchers also received information from callers that was not passed along to commanders on the scene the 911 attacks resulted in immediate responses to the event including domestic reactions closings and cancellations hate crimes muslimamerican responses to the event international responses to the attack and military responses to the events an extensive compensation program was quickly established by congress in the

these instructions were not relayed in time for the fighters to take action some fighters took to the air without live ammunition knowing that to prevent the hijackers from striking their intended targets the pilots might have to intercept and crash their fighters into the hijacked planes possibly ejecting at the last moment for the first time in us history the emergency preparedness plan called security control of air traffic and air navigation aids scatana was invoked thus stranding tens of thousands of passengers across the world ben sliney in his first day as the national

donations across the us surged in the weeks after 911 the deaths of adults in the attacks resulted in over 3000 children losing a parent subsequent studies documented childrens reactions to these actual losses and to feared losses of life the protective environment in the attacks aftermath and the effects on surviving caregivers following the attacks president george w bushs approval rating

applications had been received from the families of those who were killed contingency plans for the continuity of government and the evacuation of leaders were implemented soon after the attacks congress was not told that the united states had been under a continuity of government status until february 2002 in the largest restructuring of the us government in contemporary history the united states enacted the homeland security act of 2002 creating the us department of homeland security congress also passed the usa patriot act saying it would help detect and prosecute terrorism and other crimes civil liberties groups have criticized the patriot act saying it allows law enforcement to invade citizens privacy and that it eliminates judicial oversight of law enforcement and domestic intelligence in an effort to effectively combat future acts of terrorism the national security agency nsa was given broad powers nsa commenced warrantless surveillance of telecommunications which was sometimes criticized since it permitted the agency to eavesdrop on telephone and email communications between the united states and people overseas without a warrant in response to requests by various intelligence agencies the united states foreign intelligence surveillance court permitted an expansion of powers by the us government in seeking obtaining and sharing information on us citizens as well as nonus people from around the world six days after the attacks president bush made a public appearance at washington dcs largest islamic center and acknowledged the incredibly valuable contribution that millions of american muslims made to their country and called for them to be treated with respect numerous incidents of harassment and hate crimes against muslims and south asians

after the attacks according to an academic study people perceived to be middle eastern were as likely to be victims of hate crimes as followers of islam during this time the study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against people who may have been perceived as muslims arabs and others thought to be of middle eastern origin a report by the south asian american advocacy group known as south asian americans leading together documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against americans of south asian or middle eastern descent between september 11 and 17 2001 various crimes such as vandalism arson assault shootings harassment and threats in numerous places were documented women wearing hijab were also targeted a poll of arabamericans conducted in may 2002 found that 20 had personally experienced discrimination since september 11 a july 2002 poll of muslim americans found that 48 believed their lives had changed for the worse since september 11 and 57 had experienced an act of bias or discrimination following the september 11 attacks many pakistani americans identified themselves as indians to avoid potential discrimination and obtain jobs pakistan was created as a result of the partition of india in 1947 by may 2002 there were 488 complaints of employment discrimination reported to the us equal employment opportunity commission eeoc 301 of those were complaints from people fired from their jobs similarly by june 2002 the us department of transportation dot had investigated 111 september 11threlated complaints from airline passengers purporting that their religious or ethnic appearance caused them to be singled out at security screenings dot investigated an additional 31 complaints from people who alleged they were completely blocked from boarding airplanes on the same grounds muslim organizations in the united states were swift to condemn the attacks and called upon muslim americans to come forward with their skills and resources to help alleviate the sufferings of the affected people and their families these organizations included the islamic society of north america american muslim alliance american muslim council council on americanislamic relations islamic circle of north america and the sharia scholars association of north america along with monetary donations many islamic organizations launched blood drives and provided medical assistance food and shelter for victims curiosity about islam increased after the attacks as a result many mosques and islamic centers began holding open houses and participating in

involved in interfaith worship doubled from 7 to 14 percent the attacks were denounced by mass media and governments worldwide across the globe nations offered proamerican support and solidarity leaders in most middle eastern countries as well as libya and afghanistan condemned the attacks iraq was a notable exception with an immediate official statement that the american cowboys are reaping the fruit of their crimes against humanity the government of saudi arabia officially condemned the attacks but privately many saudis favored bin ladens cause although palestinian authority pa president yasser arafat also condemned the attacks there were reports of celebrations of disputed size in the west bank gaza strip and east jerusalem palestinian leaders discredited news broadcasters that justified the attacks or showed celebrations and the authority claimed such celebrations do not represent the palestinians sentiment adding that it would not allow a few kids to smear the real face of the palestinians footage by cnnvague and other news outlets were suggested by a report originating at a brazilian university to be from 1991 this was later proven to be a false accusation resulting in a statement being issued by cnn as in the united states the aftermath of the attacks saw tensions increase in other countries between muslims and nonmuslims united nations security council resolution 1368 condemned the attacks and expressed readiness to take all necessary steps to respond and combat all forms of terrorism in accordance with their charter numerous countries

attacks on the united states were an attack on all nato nations that satisfied article 5 of the nato charter this marked the first invocation of article 5 which had been written during the cold war with an attack by the soviet union in mind australian prime minister john howard who was in washington dc during the attacks invoked article iv of the anzus treaty the bush administration announced a war on terror with the stated goals of bringing bin laden and alqaeda to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks these goals would be accomplished by imposing economic and military sanctions against states harboring terrorists and increasing global surveillance and intelligence sharing on september 14 2001 the us congress passed the authorization for use of military force against terrorists it is still in effect and grants the president the authority to use all necessary and appropriate force against those whom he determined planned authorized committed or aided the september 11 attacks or who harbored said persons or groups on october 7 2001 the war in afghanistan began when us and british forces initiated aerial bombing campaigns targeting taliban and alqaeda camps then later invaded afghanistan with ground troops of the special forcescitation needed this eventually led to the overthrow of the talibans rule of afghanistan with the fall of kandahar

known carcinogens were spread across lower manhattan due to the twin towers collapse exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at ground zero the bush administration ordered the environmental protection agency epa to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality in the aftermath of the attacks citing national security but the epa did not determine that air quality had returned to preseptember 11 levels until june 2002 health effects extended to residents students and office workers of lower manhattan and nearby chinatown several deaths have been linked to the toxic dust and the victims names were included in the world trade center memorial approximately 18000 people have been estimated to have developed illnesses as a result of the toxic dust there is also scientific speculation that exposure to various toxic products in the air may have negative effects on fetal developmentcitation needed a study of rescue workers released in april 2010 found that all those studied had impaired lung functions and that 30–40 were reporting little or no improvement in persistent symptoms that started within the first year of the attack years after the attacks legal disputes over the costs of illnesses related to the attacks were still in the court system on october 17 2006 a federal judge rejected new york citys refusal to pay for health costs for rescue workers allowing for the possibility of numerous suits against the city government officials have been faulted for urging the public to return to lower manhattan in the weeks shortly after the attacks christine todd whitman administrator of the epa in the attacks aftermath was heavily criticized by a us district judge for incorrectly saying that the area was environmentally safe mayor giuliani was criticized for urging financial industry personnel to return quickly to the greater wall street area on december 22 2010 the united states

program which provides testing and treatment for people suffering from longterm health problems related to the 911 attacks the wtc health program replaced preexisting 911related health programs such as the medical monitoring and treatment program and the wtc environmental health center program in 2020 the nypd confirmed that 247 nypd police officers had died due to 911related illnesses in september 2022 the fdny confirmed that the total number of firefighters that died due to 911related illnesses was 299 both agencies believe that the death toll will rise dramatically in the coming years the port authority of new york and new jersey police department papd the law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the world trade center due to the port authority of new york and new jersey owning the site confirmed that four of its police officers have died of 911related illnesses the chief of the papd at the time joseph morris made sure that industrialgrade respirators were provided to all papd police officers within 48 hours and decided that the same 30 to 40 police officers would be stationed at the world trade center pile drastically lowering the number of total papd personnel who would be exposed to the air the fdny and nypd had rotated hundreds if not thousands of different personnel from all over new york city to the pile which exposed many of them to dust that would give them cancer or other diseases years or decades later also they werent given adequate respirators and breathing equipment that could have prevented future diseases the attacks had a significant economic impact on united states and world markets the stock exchanges did not open on september 11 and remained closed until september 17 reopening the dow jones industrial average djia fell 684

whether these jobs would return and if the damaged tax base would recover studies of 911s economic effects show the manhattan office realestate market and office employment were less affected than first feared because of the financial services industrys need for facetoface interaction north american air space was closed for several days after the attacks and air travel decreased upon its reopening leading to a nearly 20 cutback in air travel capacity and exacerbating financial problems in the struggling us airline industry the september 11 attacks also led to the us wars in afghanistan and iraq as well as additional homeland security spending totaling at least 5\\xa0trillion if there are americans clamoring to bomb afghanistan back to the stone age they ought to know that this nation does not have so far to go this is a postapocalyptic place of felled cities parched land and downtrodden people — barry bearak the new york times september 13 2001 most of the afghan population was already going hungry at the time of the september 11 attacks in the aftermath of the attacks tens of thousands of people attempted to flee afghanistan due to the possibility of military retaliation by the united states pakistan already home to many afghan refugees from previous conflicts closed its border with afghanistan on september 17 2001 thousands of afghans also fled to the frontier with tajikistan although were denied entry the taliban leaders in afghanistan themselves pleaded against military action saying we appeal to the united states not to put afghanistan into more misery because our people have suffered so much referring to two decades of conflict and the humanitarian crisis attached to it all united nations expatriates had left afghanistan after the attacks and no national or international aid workers were at their post workers were instead preparing in bordering countries like pakistan china and uzbekistan to prevent a potential humanitarian catastrophe amid a critically low food stock for the afghan population the world food programme stopped importing wheat to afghanistan on september 12 due to security risks the wall street journal suggested the creation of a buffer zone in an inevitable war similarly as in the bosnian war approximately one month after the attacks the united states led a broad coalition of international forces to overthrow the taliban regime from afghanistan for their harboring of alqaeda though pakistani authorities were initially reluctant to align themselves with the united states against the taliban they permitted the coalition access to their military bases and arrested and handed over to the us over 600 suspected alqaeda members in a speech by the nizari ismaili imam at the nobel institute in 2005 aga khan iv stated that the 911 attack on the united states was a direct consequence of the international community ignoring the human tragedy that was afghanistan at that time in 2011 the us and nato under president obama initiated a drawdown of troops in afghanistan finalized in 2016 during the presidencies of donald trump and joe biden in 2020 and 2021 the united states alongside its nato allies withdrew all troops from afghanistan completing the withdrawal of all regular us troops on august 30 2021 12 days before the 20th anniversary of the september 11 attacks the withdrawal marked the end of the 2001–2021 war in afghanistan biden said that after nearly 20 years of war it was clear that the us military could not transform afghanistan into a modern democracy the second emir of alqaeda ayman alzawahiri a close associate of bin laden was killed in a us drone strike at his home in kabul afghanistan on july 31 2022 the impact of 911 extends beyond geopolitics and into society and culture in general immediate responses to 911 included greater focus on home life and time spent with family higher church attendance and increased expressions of patriotism such as the flying of american flags the radio industry responded by removing certain songs from playlists and the attacks have subsequently been used as background narrative or thematic elements in film music literature and humor alreadyrunning television shows as well as programs developed after 911 have reflected post911 cultural concerns 911 conspiracy theories have become social phenomena despite lack of support from expert scientists engineers and historians 911 has also had a major impact on the religious faith of many individuals for some it strengthened to find consolation to cope with the loss of loved ones and overcome their grief others started to question their faith or lose it entirely because they could not reconcile it with their view of religion the culture of america succeeding the attacks is noted for heightened security and an increased demand thereof as well as paranoia and anxiety regarding future terrorist attacks that includes most of the nation psychologists have also confirmed that there has been an increased amount of national anxiety in commercial air travel antimuslim hate crimes rose nearly tenfold in 2001 and have subsequently remained roughly five times higher than the pre911 rate as a result of the attacks many governments across the world passed legislation to combat terrorism in germany where several of the 911 terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that countrys liberal asylum policies two major antiterrorism packages were enacted the first removed legal loopholes that permitted terrorists to live and raise money in germany the second addressed

2013–present representative jim sensenbrennerr wisconsin who introduced the patriot act in 2001 said that the nsa overstepped its bounds criticism of the war on terror has focused on its morality efficiency and cost according to a 2021 study conducted under the auspices of the watson institute for international and public affairs the several post911 wars participated in by the united states in its war on terror have caused the displacement conservatively calculated of 38 million people in afghanistan pakistan iraq libya syria yemen somalia and the philippines the study estimated these wars caused the deaths of 897000 to 929000 people and cost 8 trillion the us constitution and us law prohibits the use of torture yet such human rights violations occurred during the war on terror under the euphemism enhanced interrogation in 2005 the washington post and human rights watch hrw published revelations concerning cia flights and black sites covert prisons operated by the cia the term torture by proxy is used by some critics to describe situations in which the cia and other us agencies have transferred suspected terrorists to countries known to employ torture immediately after the attacks the federal bureau of investigation started penttbom the largest criminal inquiry in united states history at its height more than half of the fbis agents worked on the investigation and followed a halfmillion leads the fbi concluded that there was clear and irrefutable evidence linking alqaeda and bin laden to the attacks the fbi was quickly able to identify the hijackers including leader mohamed atta when his luggage was discovered at bostons logan airport atta had been forced to check two of his three bags due to space limitations on the 19seat commuter flight he took to boston due to a new policy instituted to prevent flight delays the luggage failed to make it aboard american airlines flight 11 as planned the luggage contained the hijackers names assignments and alqaeda connections it had all these arablanguage sic papers that amounted to the rosetta stone of the investigation said one fbi agent within hours of the attacks the fbi released the names and in many cases the personal details of the suspected pilots and hijackers abu jandal who served as bin ladens chief bodyguard for years confirmed the identity of seven hijackers as alqaeda members during interrogations with the fbi on september 17 he had been jailed in a yemeni prison since 2000 on september 27 2001 photos of all 19 hijackers were released along with information about possible nationalities and aliases fifteen of the men were from saudi arabia two were from the united arab emirates one was from egypt and one was from lebanon by midday the us national security agency and german intelligence agencies had intercepted communications pointing to osama bin laden two of the hijackers were known to have traveled with a bin laden associate to malaysia in 2000 and hijacker mohamed atta had previously gone to afghanistan he and others were part of a terrorist cell in hamburg one of the members of the hamburg cell in germany was discovered to have been in communication with khalid sheikh mohammed who was identified as a member of alqaeda authorities in the united states and united kingdom also obtained electronic intercepts including telephone conversations and electronic bank transfers which indicated that mohammed atef a bin laden deputy was a key figure in the planning of the 911 attacks intercepts were also obtained that revealed conversations that took place days before september 11 between bin laden and an associate in pakistan in those conversations the two referred to an incident that would take place in america on or around september 11 and they discussed potential repercussions in another conversation with an associate in afghanistan bin laden discussed the scale and effects of a forthcoming operation these conversations did not specifically mention the world trade center the pentagon or other specifics in their annual violent crime index for the year of 2001 the fbi recorded the deaths from the attacks as murder in separate tables so as not to mix them with other reported crime for that year in a disclaimer the fbi stated that the number of deaths is so great that combining it with the traditional crime statistics will have an outlier effect that falsely skews all types of measurements in the programs analyses new york city also did not include the deaths in their annual crime statistics for 2001 in 2004 john l helgerson the inspector general of the central intelligence agency cia conducted an internal review of the agencys pre911 performance and was harshly critical of senior cia officials for not doing everything possible to confront terrorism according to philip giraldi in the american conservative helgerson criticized their failure to stop two of the 911 hijackers nawaf alhazmi and khalid almihdhar as they entered the united states and their failure to share information on the two men with the fbibetter\\xa0source\\xa0needed in may 2007 senators from both major us political parties the republican and democratic party drafted legislation to make the review public one of the backers senator ron wyden said the american people have a right to know what the central intelligence agency was doing in those critical months before 911 the report was released in 2009 by president barack obama in february 2002 the senate select committee on intelligence and the house permanent select committee on intelligence formed a joint inquiry into the performance of the us intelligence community their 832page report released in december 2002 detailed failings of the fbi and cia to use available information including about terrorists the cia knew were in the united states in order to disrupt the plots the joint inquiry developed its information about possible involvement of saudi arabian government officials from nonclassified sources nevertheless the bush administration demanded 28 related pages remain classified in december 2002 the inquirys chair bob graham dfl revealed in an interview that there was evidence that there were foreign governments involved in facilitating the activities of at least some of the terrorists in the united states september 11 victim families were frustrated by the unanswered questions and redacted material from the congressional inquiry and demanded an independent commission september 11 victim families members of congress and the saudi arabian government are still seeking release of the documents in june 2016 cia chief john brennan said that he believes 28 redacted pages of a congressional inquiry into 911 will soon be made public and that they will prove that the government of saudi arabia had no involvement in the september 11 attacks in september 2016 the congress passed the justice against sponsors of terrorism act that would allow relatives of victims of the september 11 attacks to sue saudi arabia for its governments alleged role in the attacks the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states popularly known as the 911 commission chaired by thomas kean governor of new jersey from 1982 to 1990 was formed in late 2002 to prepare a thorough account of the circumstances surrounding the attacks including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks on july 22 2004 the commission issued the 911 commission report the report detailed the events leading up to the september 11 attacks concluding that they were carried out by alqaeda the commission also examined how security and intelligence agencies were inadequately coordinated to prevent the attacks on july 22 2004 the 911 commission released the 911 commission report a 585page report based on its investigations and interviews according to the report we believe the 911 attacks revealed four kinds of failures in imagination policy capabilities and management the commission made numerous recommendations on how to prevent future attacks and in 2011 was dismayed that several of its recommendations had yet to be implemented the us national institute of standards and technology nist investigated the collapses of the twin towers and 7\\xa0wtc the investigations examined why the buildings collapsed and what fire protection measures were in place and evaluated how fire protection systems might be improved in future construction the investigation into the collapse of 1\\xa0wtc and 2\\xa0wtc was concluded in october 2005 and that of 7\\xa0wtc was completed in august 2008 nist found that the fireproofing on the twin towers steel infrastructures was blown off by the initial impact of the planes and that had this not occurred the towers likely would have remained standing a 2007 study of the north towers collapse published by researchers of purdue university determined that since the planes impact had stripped off much of the structures thermal insulation the heat from a typical office fire would have softened and weakened the exposed girders and columns enough to initiate the collapse regardless of the number of columns cut or damaged by the impact the director of the original investigation stated that the towers really did amazingly well the terrorist aircraft didnt bring the buildings down it was the fire which followed it was proven that you could take out twothirds of the columns in a tower and the building would still stand the fires weakened the trusses supporting the floors making the floors sag the sagging floors pulled on the exterior steel columns causing the exterior columns to bow inward with the damage to the core columns the buckling exterior columns could no longer support the buildings causing them to collapse additionally the report found the towers stairwells were not adequately reinforced to provide adequate emergency escape for people above the impact zones nist concluded that uncontrolled fires in 7\\xa0wtc caused floor beams and girders to heat and subsequently caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fireinduced progressive collapse that brought the building down in july 2016 the obama administration released a document compiled by us investigators dana lesemann and michael jacobson known as file 17 which contains a list naming three dozen people including the suspected saudi intelligence officers attached to saudi arabias embassy in washington dc which connects saudi arabia to the hijackers in september 2016 congress passed the justice against sponsors of terrorism act the practical effect of the legislation was to allow the continuation of a longstanding civil lawsuit brought by families of victims of the september 11 attacks against saudi arabia for its governments alleged role in the attacks in march 2018 a us judge formally allowed a suit to move forward against the government of saudi arabia brought by 911 survivors and victims families in 2022 the families of some 911 victims obtained two videos and a notepad seized from saudi national omar albayoumi by the british courts the first video showed him hosting a party in san diego for nawaf alhazmi and khalid almihdhar the first two hijackers to arrive in the us the other video showed albayoumi greeting the cleric anwar alawlaki who was blamed for radicalizing americans and later killed in a cia drone strike the notepad depicted a handdrawn airplane and some mathematical equations that according to a pilots court statement might have been used to calculate the rate of descent to get to a target according to a 2017 fbi memo from the late 1990s up until the 911 attack albayoumi was a paid cooptee of the saudi general intelligence presidency

khan was named one of time magazines 100 most influential people of 2019 in the section leaders in domestic economic policy khan inherited a twin balance of payments and debt crisis with a large current account deficit and fiscal deficit in 2018 khans government sought a bailout from the imf in exchange for the bailout khans government slashed subsidy spending in the energy sector and unveiled an austerity budget to curb the fiscal deficit and limit government borrowing also the imf demanded that the pakistani government depreciate the rupee and improve tax collection khans government decided to raise import tariffs to collect higher tax revenues and devalued the currency this alongside the heavy import duty helped to curtail the current account deficit see import substitution pakistans overall balance of payments position improved significantly following recordhigh remittances in 2020 which stabilised the central banks foreign exchange reserves the fiscal deficit narrowed to less than 1 of gdp by 2020 due to the governments austerity policies\\nthus the rate of debt accumulation had significantly slowed but pakistans debt remained high due to the high borrowing of previous governments in which the current government had to allocate 24 billion to pay off loans taken during the tenure of previous governments aside from imfmandated reforms khans government introduced policies to improve the business operating climate as a result pakistan climbed 28 places higher on the world banks ease of doing business index pakistan ranked amongst the top 10 most improved countries in 2019 pakistans tax collection also hit record highs in 2019 as the government raised more revenue from domestic taxes with no increase in tax revenue from import taxes given import compression had lowered the quantity being imported so the government collected less tax revenue from imports this trend continued into 2020 albeit at a slower pace the fiscal deficit was also controlled to less than 1 of gdp in the second half of 2020 pakistan recorded a primary surplus excluding interest payment and principal repayment of previous debt but was in deficit once the interest payment on debt was accounted for albeit the deficit was smaller economists primarily pinned this reduction in the fiscal deficit on an increase in nontax revenues rather than an increase in tax revenues for example from the higher prices consumers paid for oil from stateowned oil companies nevertheless tax revenues also went on an upward trajectory with pakistans tax agency fbr both exceeding its tax collection target and collecting a record amount for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021 in the calendar year 2020 in economic policy with respect to international trade from january 2020 khans government implemented the second phase of the china–pakistan free trade agreement these renegotiations with china led to concessionary rates by china on pakistani exports of goods and services to mainland china such as reduced tariffs or zero tariffs the negotiations were termed a significant milestone in the countrys foreign policy by expanding trade relations in a relationship traditionally dominated by defence and security matters in june 2018 before khan became prime minister the fatf placed pakistan onto its grey list and demanded a series of actions be taken by pakistan to remedy terror financing laws khans government had initially used constitutional provisions of presidential power held by arif alvi to issue ordinances temporary legislation via presidential decree and the country became compliant with 14 points on the fatf agenda subsequently a series of bills were presented in pakistans parliament to ensure the legislation would permanently remain in place beyond a temporary presidential decree minor parts of the legislation passed both the lower house and upper house of pakistans parliament with the support of khans ruling coalition and part of the opposition parties too however the oppositiondominated senate did not pass a significant portion of the fatf bills and walked out on crucial moments creating hurdles for khans government subsequently khan summoned a joint session of both upper and lower house of parliament in which the bills passed given the government held a majority and without the support of the opposition by october 2020 pakistan became successfully compliant on 21 out of 27 points on the fatf agenda an increase from the 14 points in february 2020 with the remaining 6 points outstanding reviewed in february 2021 in fatfs february 2021 review khans government had successfully implemented about 90 of the fatf agenda with 24 out of 27 points largely addressed and the remaining 3 out of 27 points partially addressed the fatf president remarked that as pakistan was progressing with its action plan so it is not the time to put a country on the blacklist in fatfs june 2021 review the khan government implemented more progress the fatf found that pakistan has now largely addressed 26 out of the 27 action items us state department spokesperson ned price praised pakistans progress but encouraged pakistan to tackle its remaining action item saying we do recognise and we support pakistans continued efforts to satisfy those first action plan obligations pakistan has made significant progress on its first action plan with 26 of 27 action items largely addressed — we encourage pakistan to continue working with the fatf and the international community to swiftly complete the remaining action item by demonstrating that terrorism financing investigations and prosecutions target senior leaders and commanders of undesignated groups he said on 8 april 2022 the khan government made progress on its remaining action plan by sentencing hafiz saeed a mastermind of the 2008 mumbai attacks and a undesignated terrorist to 31 years in prison due to the efforts of hammad azhar

international airlines reached breakeven in operating profit however the halt in air travel in the following year due to covid19 meant further reforms had to be made this led to a proposal to cut the airlines workforce almost by half in order to save costs and thus help the stateowned airline breakeven on a net profit level in addition to the operating profit level the national airline confirmed it would layoff employees in phases as part of pias restructuring plan in line with the governments policy of reversing the losses at stateowned companies khans government is set to axe many pia

the basis that no amnesty known as nro or national reconciliation ordinance in pakistani political parlance would be given to politicians or relatives who benefitted from a politicians patronage the

his—and pakistans—clashing identities adding that his identification with the suffering masses and his attacks on his affluent englishspeaking peers have long been mocked in the living rooms of lahore

baluchistan and baluchestan is a historical region in western and south asia located in the iranian plateaus far southeast and bordering the indian plate and the arabian sea coastline this arid region of desert and mountains is primarily populated by ethnic baloch people the balochistan region is split between three countries iran afghanistan and pakistan administratively it comprises the pakistani province of balochistan the iranian province of sistan and baluchestan and the southern areas of afghanistan which include nimruz helmand and kandahar provinces it borders the khyber paktunkhwa region to the north sindh and punjab to the east and iranian regions to the west its southern coastline including the makran coast is washed by the arabian sea in particular by its western part the gulf of oman the name balochistan is generally believed to derive from the name of the baloch people since the baloch people are not mentioned in preislamic sources it is likely that the baloch were known by some other name in their place of origin and that they acquired the name baloch only after arriving in balochistan sometime in the 10th century johan hansman relates the term baloch to meluḫḫa the name by which the indus valley civilisation is believed to have been known to the sumerians 2900–2350 bc and akkadians 2334–2154 bc in mesopotamia meluḫḫa disappears from the mesopotamian records at the beginning of the second millennium bc however hansman states that a trace of it in a modified form as baluḫḫu was retained in the names of products imported by the neoassyrian empire 911–605 bc almuqaddasī who visited the capital of makran  bannajbur wrote c 985 ad that it was populated by people called balūṣī baluchi leading hansman to postulate baluch as a modification of meluḫḫa and baluḫḫu asko parpola relates the name meluḫḫa to indoaryan words mleccha sanskrit and milakkhamilakkhu pali etc which do not have an indoeuropean etymology even though they were used to refer to nonaryan people taking them to be protodravidian in origin he interprets the term as meaning either a proper name miluakam from which tamilakam was derived when the indus people migrated south or meluakam meaning high country a possible reference to balochistani high lands historian romila thapar also interprets meluḫḫa as a protodravidian term possibly mēlukku and suggests the meaning western extremity of the dravidianspeaking regions in the indian subcontinent a literal translation into sanskrit aparānta was later used to describe the region by the indoaryans during the time of alexander the great 356–323 bc the greeks called the land gedrosia and its people gedrosoi terms of unknown origin using etymological reasoning h w bailey reconstructs a possible iranian name uadravati meaning the land of underground channels which could have been transformed to badlaut in the 9th century and further to balōč in later times this reasoning remains speculative the earliest evidence of human occupation in what is now balochistan is dated to the paleolithic era evidence includes hunting camps lithic scatter and chipped and flaked stone tools the earliest settled villages in the region date to the ceramic neolithic c\\u20097000–6000 bce and included the site of mehrgarh in the kachi plain these villages expanded in size during the subsequent chalcolithic when interaction was amplified this involved the movement of finished goods and raw materials including chank shell lapis lazuli turquoise and ceramics by 2500 bce the bronze age the region now known as pakistani balochistan had become part of the indus valley civilization cultural orbit providing key resources to the expansive settlements of the indus river basin to the east from the 1st century to the 3rd century ce the region was ruled by the pāratarājas lit pārata kings a dynasty of indoparthian kings the dynasty of the pāratas is thought to be identical with the pāradas of the mahabharata the puranas and other vedic and iranian sources the parata kings are primarily known through their coins which typically exhibit the bust of the ruler with long hair in a headband on the obverse and a swastika within a circular legend on the reverse written in brahmi usually silver coins or kharoshthi copper coins these coins are mainly found in loralai in todays western pakistan during the wars between alexander the great 356323 bc and emperor darius iii 336330 bc the baloch were allied with the last achaemenid emperor according to shustheri 1925 darius iii after much hesitation assembled an army at arbela to counter the army of invading greeks his cousin besius was the commander leading the horsemen from balkh berzanthis was the commander of the baloch forces okeshthra was the commander of the forces from khuzistan maseus was the commander of the syrian and egyptian contingent ozbed was the commander of the medes and phirthaphirna was leading the sakas and forces from tabaristan gurgan and khurasan obviously as part of a losing side the baloch certainly got their share of punishment from the victorious macedonian forces herodotus in 450 bce described the paraitakenoi as a tribe ruled by deiokes a persian king in northwestern persia history i101 arrian describes how alexander the great encountered the pareitakai in bactria and sogdiana and had them conquered by craterus anabasis alexandrou iv the periplus of the erythraean sea 1st century ce describes the territory of the paradon beyond the ommanitic region on the coast of modern balochistan during the reign of arab dynasties the medieval iran suffered the onslaught of ghaznavids mongols timurids and the incursions of guzz turks the relationship between the baloch and nearly all these powers were hostile and the baloch suffered enormously during this long period the baloch encounters with these powers and the subsequent baloch miseries forced the baloch tribes to move from the areas of conflicts and to settle in the farflung and inaccessible regions the bloody conflicts with buyids and seljuqs were instrumental in waves of migration by the baloch tribes from kerman to further east the hindu sewa dynasty ruled parts of balochistan chiefly kalat the sibi division which was carved out of quetta division and kalat division in 1974 derives its name from rani sewi the queen of the sewa dynasty the region was fully islamized by the 9th century and became part of the territory of the saffarids of zaranj followed by the ghaznavids then the ghorids the relation between the ghaznavids and the baloch had never been peaceful turan and makuran came under the ghaznavids founder sebuktegins suzerainty as early as ad 976977 bosworth 1963 the baloch tribes fought against sebuktegin when he attacked khuzdar in ad 994 the baloch were in the army of saffarids amir khalaf and fought against mahmud when the ghaznavids forces invaded sistan in ad 1013 muir 1924 many other occasions were mentioned by the historians of the ghaznavids era in which the baloch came into confrontation with the ghaznavids forces nizam almulk 1960 there are only passing references of baloch encounters with the mongol hordes in one of the classical balochi ballads there is mention of a baloch chieftain shah baloch who no doubt heroically resisted a mongol advance somewhere in sistancitation needed during the long period of en masse migrations the baloch were traveling through settled territories and it could not have been possible to survive simply as wandering nomads perpetual migrations hostile attitudes of other tribes and rulers and adverse climactic conditions ruined much of their cattle breeding settled agriculture became a necessity for the survival of herds and an increased population they began to combine settled agriculture with animal husbandry the baloch tribes now consisted of sedentary and nomadic population a composition that remained an established feature of the baloch tribes until recently the khanate of kalat was the first unified polity to emerge in the history of balochistan it took birth from the confederacy of nomadic brahui tribes native to the central balochistan in 1666 which under mir ahmad khan i declared independence from the mughal suzeraignty and slowly absorbed the baloch principalities in the region it was ruled over by the brahui ahmadzai dynasty till 1948 ahmad shah durrani made it vassal of the afghan durrani empire in 1749 in 1758 the khan of kalat mir naseer khan i revolted against ahmed shah durrani defeated him and made his khanate independent from the durrani empire baloch tribalism in medieval times was synonymous with pastoral nomadism nomadic people as observed by heape 1931 regard themselves as the superior of sedentary or agriculturist it is perhaps because the occupation of nomads made them strong active and inured to hardship and the dangers which beset a mobile life the areas of balochistan where the baloch tribes moved in had a sedentary population and the baloch tribes were compelled to deal with their sedentary neighbors being in a weaker position the baloch tribes were in need of constant vigils for their survival in new lands to deal with this problem they began to make alliances and organized themselves into a more structured way the structural solution to this problem was to create tribal confederacies or unions thus in conditions of insecurity and disorder or when threatened by a predatory regional authority or a hostile central government several tribal communities would form a cluster around a chief who had demonstrated his ability to offer protection and security the british took over the areawhich in 1839 in the 1870s baluchistan came under control of the british indian empire in colonial india  the fundamental objective of the british to enter into a treaty agreement with the khanate of kalat was to provide a passage and supplies to the army of indus on its way to kandahar through shikarpur jacobabad khangadh dhadar bolan pass quetta and khojak pass it is interesting to note that the british imperialist interests in balochistan were not primarily economic as was the case with other regions of india rather it was of a military and geopolitical nature their basic objective in their advent in balochistan was to station garrisons so as to defend the frontiers of british india from any threat coming from iran and afghanistan beginning from 1840 there began a general insurrection against the british rule throughout balochistan the baloch were not ready to accept their country as part of an occupied afghanistan and to be ruled under a puppet khan the powerful mari tribe rose in total revolt the british retaliated with excessive force and a british contingent under the command of major brown on may 11 1840 attacked the mari headquarter of kahan and occupied kahan fort and the surrounding areas masson 1974 the mari forces withdrew from the area regrouped and in an ambush wiped out a whole convoy of british troops near filiji killing more than one hundred british troops during the time of the indian independence movement three procongress parties were still active in balochistans politics such as the anjumaniwatan baluchistan which favoured a united india and opposed its partition in 2021 there was an earthquake that killed dozens of people this came to be known as the 2021 balochistan earthquake there were other major earthquakes in 2013 2013 balochistan earthquake  and 2013 saravan earthquake the cultural values which are the pillars of the baloch individual and national identity were firmly established during the twelfth and sixteenth centuries a period which not only brought sufferings for the baloch and forced them into en masse migrations but also brought fundamental sociocultural transformation of the baloch society an overlapping of pastoral ecology and tribal structure had shaped contemporary baloch social values the pastoralist nomadic way of life and the inclination to resist the assimilation attempts of various powerful ethnic identities shaped the peculiar baloch ethnic identity it was the persecution by strong and organized religions for the last two thousand years that has shaped their secular attitude about religion in social or community affairs their independent and stubborn behavior as the distinctive feature of the baloch identity is consistent with their nomadic or agropastoral past med o maraka for resolution of disputes among the baloch is a muchhonored tradition in a broader context it is in a way accepting the guilt by the accused or offender and asking for forgiveness from the affected party usually the offender himself does this by going to the home of the affected person and asking for forgiveness dress code and personal upkeeping are among the cultural values which distinguish a baloch from others the baloch dress and personal upkeeping very much resemble the median and parthian ways surprisingly no significant changes can be observed in the balochi dress since the ancient times a typical balochi outfit consisted of loosefitting and manyfolded trousers held by garters bobbed hair shirt qamis and a head turban generally both hair and beard were carefully curled but sometimes they depended on long straight locks a typical dress of a baloch woman consists of a long frock and trouser shalwaar with a headscarf historically there is no documented evidence of religious practices of the baloch in ancient times many among the baloch writers observed that the persecutions of the baloch by the sassanid emperors shapur ii and khosrow ii had a strong religious or sectarian element they believed that there are strong indications that the baloch were the followers of mazdakian and manichean sects of zoroastrianism religion at the time of their fatal encounters with sassanid forces no elaborate structure of religious institutions has been visible in the baloch society during the middle ages originally the baloch were the followers of the zoroastrian religion and its various sects converted to islam nearly all baloch belong to the sunni sect of islam after the arab conquest of balochistan during the seventh century the balochistan region is administratively divided among three countries pakistan afghanistan and iran the largest portion in area and population is in pakistan whose largest province in land area is balochistan an estimated 69 million of pakistans population is baloch in iran there are about two million ethnic baloch and a majority of the population of the eastern sistan and baluchestan province is of baloch ethnicity the afghan portion of balochistan includes the chahar burjak district of nimruz province and the registan desert in southern helmand and kandahar provinces the governors of nimruz province in afghanistan belong to the baloch ethnic group president pervez musharraf and the military are responsible for the worsening of the conflict in balochistan the balochistan region has also experienced a number of insurgencies with separatist militants demanding independence of baloch regions in the three countries to form greater balochistan in pakistan insurgencies by separatist militants in balochistan province have been fought in 1948 1958–59 1962–63 and 1973–1977 with a new ongoing lowintensity insurgency beginning in 2003 historically drivers of the conflict are reported to include tribal divisions the balochpashtun ethnic divisions marginalization by punjabi interests and\\neconomic oppression however over the years insurgency waged by separatist militants declined as result of crackdown by pakistani security forces infighting among the separatist militants and assassinations of baloch politicians willing to take part in pakistans democratic process by the separatist militants separatist militants in pakistan demand more autonomy and a greater share in the regions natural resources the baloch population in pakistan has endured grave violations of human rights which include extrajudicial killings enforced disappearances and torture these actions are purportedly perpetrated by state security forces and their associates in 2019 united states declared baloch liberation army one of the separatist militants fighting the government of pakistan a global terrorist group in iran separatist fighting has reportedly not gained as much ground as the conflict in pakistan but has grown and become more sectarian since 2012 with the majoritysunni baloch showing a greater degree of salafist and antishia ideology in their fight against the shiaislamist iranian government separatist militants fighting in iran demand more rights for ethnic baloch living in irans sistan and baluchestan province the main

northwestern region of the country khyber pakhtunkhwa is the fourth largest province of pakistan by land area and the thirdlargest province by population it is bordered by the pakistani provinces of balochistan to the south punjab to the southeast the territory of gilgitbaltistan to the north and northeast islamabad capital territory to the east and azad kashmir to the northeast it shares an international border with afghanistan to the west khyber pakhtunkhwa has a varied landscape ranging from rugged mountain ranges valleys plains surrounded by hills undulating submontane areas and dense agricultural farms while it is the thirdlargest pakistani province in terms of both its population and its economy it is geographically the smallest the province is home to 179 percent of pakistans total population the province is multiethnic with the main ethnic groups being the pashtuns hindkowans saraikis and chitralis once a stronghold of buddhism khyber pakhtunkhwa is the site of the ancient region of gandhara including the ruins of the gandharan capital of pushkalavati located near modernday charsadda the regions history is characterized by frequent invasions by various empires largely due to its geographical proximity to the historically important khyber pass although it is colloquially known by a variety of other names the name khyber pakhtunkhwa was brought into effect for the northwest frontier province in april 2010 following the passing of the 18th constitutional amendment on 24 may 2018 the national assembly of pakistan voted in favour of the 25th constitutional amendment which merged the fata as well as the provincially administered tribal areas into khyber pakhtunkhwa the provincial assembly of khyber pakhtunkhwa subsequently approved the bill on 28 may 2018 it was signed into law on 31 may by erstwhile pakistani president mamnoon hussain which officially completed the administrative merger process khyber pakhtunkhwa means the khyber side of the land of the pashtuns where the word pakhtunkhwa means land of the pashtuns while according to some scholars it refers to pashtun culture and society when the british established it as a province they called it north west frontier province abbreviated as nwfp until 2010 due to its relative location being in the northwest of their indian empire after the creation of pakistan pakistan continued with this name but a pashtun political party awami national party based in the province demanded that the province name be changed to pakhtunkhwa their logic behind that demand was that punjabi people sindhi people and baloch people have their provinces named after their ethnicities but that is not the case for pashtun people pakistan muslim league n the largest opposition party at the time was ready to change the provinces name by supporting the ruling pakistan peoples party and anp in a constitutional amendment but wanted to name the province something other than which does not carry only the pashtun identity in it as they argued that there were other minor communities living in the province especially the hazarewals of the hazara region who spoke hindko thus the word khyber was introduced with the name because it is the name of a major pass which connects pakistan to afghanistan during the times of indus valley civilisation 3300 bce – 1700 bce the khyber pass through hindu kush provided a route to other neighbouring empires and was used by merchants on trade excursions from 1500 bce indoiranian peoples started to enter in the region from central asia after having passed the khyber pass the region of gandhara which was primarily based in the area of modernday khyber pakhtunkhwa features prominently in the rigveda c\\u20091500\\xa0– c\\u20091200 bce as well as the zoroastrian avesta which mentions it as vaēkərəta the sixth most beautiful place on earth created by ahura mazda it was one of the 16 mahajanapadas of vedic era it was the centre of vedic and later forms of hinduism gandhara was frequently mentioned in vedic epics including rig veda ramayana and mahabharata it was the home of gandhari the princess of gandhara kingdom in the spring of 327 bc alexander the great crossed the hindu kush and advanced to nicaea where omphis king of taxila and other chiefs joined him alexander then dispatched part of his force through the valley of the kabul river while he himself advanced into bajaur and swat with his light troops craterus was ordered to fortify and repopulate arigaion probably in bajaur which its inhabitants had burnt and deserted having defeated the aspasians from whom he took 40000 prisoners and 230000 oxen alexander crossed the gouraios panjkora and entered the territory of the assakenoi and laid siege to massaga which he took by storm ora and bazira possibly bazar soon fell the people of bazira fled to the rock aornos but alexander made embolima possibly amb his base and attacked the rock from there which was captured after a desperate resistance meanwhile peukelaotis in hashtnagar 17 miles 27\\xa0km northwest of peshawar had submitted and nicanor a macedonian was appointed satrap of the country west of the indus mauryan rule began with chandragupta maurya displacing the nanda empire establishing the mauryan empire a while after alexanders general seleucus had attempted to once again invade the subcontinent from the khyber pass hoping to take lands that alexander had conquered but never fully absorbed into this empire seleucus was defeated and the lands of aria arachosia gandhara and gedrosia were ceded to the mauryans in exchange for a matrimonial alliance and 500 elephants with the defeat of the greeks the land was once more under hindu rule chandraguptas son bindusara further expanded the empire however it was chandraguptas grandson ashoka who converted to buddhism and made it the official state religion in gandhara and also pakhli the modern hazara as evidenced by rockinscriptions at shahbazgarhi and mansehra after ashokas death the mauryan empire fell to pieces just as in the west the seleucid power was waning the indogreek king menander i reigned 155–130 bce drove the grecobactrians out of gandhara and beyond the hindu kush becoming king shortly after his victory his empire survived him in a fragmented manner until the last independent greek king strato ii disappeared around 10 ce around 125 bce the grecobactrian king heliocles son of eucratides fled from the yuezhi invasion of bactria and relocated to gandhara pushing the indogreeks east of the jhelum river the last known indogreek ruler was theodamas from the bajaur area of gandhara mentioned on a 1stcentury ce signet ring bearing the kharoṣṭhī inscription su theodamasa su was the greek transliteration of the kushan royal title shau shah or king it is during this period that the fusion of hellenistic and south asian mythological artistic and religious elements becomes most apparent especially in the region of gandhara local greek rulers still exercised a feeble and precarious power along the borderland but the last vestige of the grecoindian rulers were finished by a people known to the old chinese as the yeuhchi the indoscythians were descended from the sakas scythians who migrated from central asia into south asia from the middle of the 2nd century bce to the 1st century bce they displaced the indogreeks and ruled a kingdom that stretched from gandhara to mathura the first indoscythian king maues established saka hegemony by conquering indogreek territories the power of the saka rulers declined after the defeat to chandragupta ii of the gupta empire in the 4th century the indoparthian kingdom was ruled by the gondopharid dynasty named after its first ruler gondophares for most of their history the leading gondopharid kings held taxila in the present punjab province of pakistan as their residence but during their last few years of existence the capital shifted between kabul and peshawar these kings have traditionally been referred to as indoparthians as their coinage was often inspired by the arsacid dynasty but they probably belonged to a wider groups of iranic tribes who lived east of parthia proper and there is no evidence that all the kings who assumed the title gondophares which means holder of glory were even related the yuezhi nomads had driven the sakas from the highlands of central asia and were themselves forced southwards by the nomadic xiongnu one group known as the kushan took the lead and its chief kadphises i seized vast territories extending south to the kabul valley his son kadphises ii conquered northwestern india which he governed through his generals his immediate successors were the fabled hindu kings kanishka huvishka and vasushka or vasudeva of whom the first reigned over a territory which extended as far east as benares far south as malwa and also including bactria and the kabul valley their dates are still a matter of dispute but it is beyond question that they reigned early in the christian era to this period may be ascribed the fine statues and basreliefs found in gandhara and udyana under huvishkas successor vasushka the dominions of the kushan kings shrank the turk shahis ruled gandhara until 870 when they were overthrown by the hindu shahis the hindu shahis are believed to belong to the uḍioḍi tribe namely the people of oddiyana in gandhara the first king kallar had moved the capital into udabandhapura from kabul in the modern village of hund for its new capital at its zenith the kingdom stretched over the kabul valley gandhara and western punjab under jayapala jayapala saw a danger in the consolidation of the ghaznavids and invaded their capital city of ghazni both in the reign of sebuktigin and in that of his son mahmud which initiated the muslim ghaznavid and hindu shahi struggles sebuk tigin however defeated him and he was forced to pay an indemnity jayapala defaulted on the payment and took to the battlefield once more jayapala however lost control of the entire region between the kabul valley and indus river however the army was defeated in battle against the western forces particularly against the mahmud of ghazni in the year 1001 soon after sultan mahmud came to power and was occupied with the qarakhanids north of the hindu kush jaipal attacked ghazni once more and upon suffering yet another defeat by the powerful ghaznavid forces near presentday peshawar after the battle of peshawar he died because of regretting as his subjects brought disaster and disgrace to the shahi dynasty jayapala was succeeded by his son anandapala who along with other succeeding generations of the shahiya dynasty took part in various unsuccessful campaigns against the advancing ghaznvids but were unsuccessful the hindu rulers eventually exiled themselves to the kashmir siwalik hills in 977 sabuktagin founded the dynasty of the ghaznavids in 986 he raided the indian frontier and in 988 defeated jaipal with his allies at laghman soon afterwards he took control of the country as far as the indus placing a governor of his own at peshawar mahmud of ghazni sabuktagins son having secured the throne of ghazni again defeated jayapala in his first raid into india 1001 battle of peshawar and in a second expedition defeated anandpal 1006 both near peshawar he also 1024 and 1025 raided the pashtuns over time mahmud of ghazni had pushed further into the subcontinent as far as east as modern day agra during his campaigns many hindu temples and buddhist monasteries had been looted and destroyed as well as many people being forcibly converted into islam in 1179 muhammad of ghor took peshawar capturing lahore from khusrau malik two years later following the invasion by the ghurids five unrelated heterogeneous dynasties ruled over the delhi sultanate sequentially the mamluk dynasty 1206–1290 the khalji dynasty 1290–1320 the tughlaq dynasty 1320–1414 the sayyid dynasty 1414–1451 and the lodi dynasty 1451–1526 meanwhile the pashtuns now appeared as a political factor at the close of the fourteenth century they were firmly established in their presentday demographics south of kohat and in 1451 bahlol lodis accession to the throne of delhi gave them a dominant position in northern india yusufzai tribes from the kabul and jalalabad valleys began migrating to the valley of peshawar beginning in the 15th century and displaced the swatis of the bhittani confederation and dilazak pashtun tribes across the indus river to hazara division mughal suzerainty over the khyber pakhtunkhwa region was partially established after babar the founder of the mughal empire invaded the region in 1505 ce via the khyber pass the mughal empire noted the importance of the region as a weak point in their empires defences and determined to hold peshawar and kabul at all cost against any threats from the uzbek shaybanids he was forced to retreat westwards to kabul but returned to defeat the lodis in july 1526 when he captured peshawar from daulat khan lodi though the region was never considered to be fully subjugated to the mughals under the reign of babars son humayun a direct mughal rule was briefly challenged with the rise of the pashtun emperor sher shah suri who began construction of the famous grand trunk road – which links kabul afghanistan with chittagong bangladesh over 2000 miles to the east later local rulers once again pledged loyalty to the mughal emperorcitation needed yusufzai tribes rose against mughals during the yusufzai revolt of 1667 and engaged in pitchedbattles with mughal battalions in peshawar and attock afridi tribes resisted aurangzeb rule during the afridi revolt of the 1670s the afridis massacred a mughal battalion in the khyber pass in 1672 and shut the pass to lucrative trade routes following another massacre in the winter of 1673 mughal armies led by emperor aurangzeb himself regained control of the entire area in 1674 and enticed tribal leaders with various awards in order to end the rebellion referred to as the father of pashto literature and hailing from the city of akora khattak the warriorpoet khushal khan khattak actively participated in the revolt against the mughals and became renowned for his poems that celebrated the rebellious pashtun warriors on 18 november 1738 peshawar was captured from the mughal governor nawab nasir khan by the afsharid armies during the persian invasion of the mughal empire under nader shah the area fell subsequently under the rule of ahmad shah durrani founder of the durrani empire following a grand nineday long assembly of leaders known as the loya jirga in 1749 the mughal ruler was induced to cede sindh the punjab region and the important trans indus river to ahmad shah in order to save his capital from the durrani attack ahmad shah invaded the remnants of the mughal empire a third time and then a fourth consolidating control over the kashmir and punjab regions in 1757 he captured delhi and sacked mathura but permitted the mughal dynasty to remain in nominal control of the city as long as the ruler acknowledged ahmad shahs suzerainty over punjab sindh and kashmir leaving his second son timur shah to safeguard his interests ahmad shah left india to return to afghanistan their rule was interrupted by a brief invasion of the hindu marathas who ruled over the region following the 1758 battle of peshawar for eleven months till early 1759 when the durrani rule was reestablished under the reign of timur shah the mughal practice of using kabul as a summer capital and peshawar as a winter capital was reintroduced peshawars bala hissar fort served as the residence of durrani kings during their winter stay in peshawar mahmud shah durrani became king and quickly sought to seize peshawar from his halfbrother shah shujah durrani shah shujah was then himself proclaimed king in 1803 and recaptured peshawar while mahmud shah was imprisoned at bala hissar fort until his eventual escape in 1809 the british sent an emissary to the court of shah shujah in peshawar marking the first diplomatic meeting between the british and afghans mahmud shah allied himself with the barakzai pashtuns and amassed an army in 1809 and captured peshawar from his halfbrother shah shujah establishing mahmud shahs second reign which lasted under 1818 ranjit singh invaded peshawar in 1818 and captured it from the durrani empire the sikh empire based in lahore did not immediately secure direct control of the peshawar region but rather paid nominal tribute to jehandad khan of khattak who was nominated by ranjit singh to be ruler of the region after ranjit singhs departure from the region khattaks rule was undermined and power seized by yar muhammad khan in 1823 ranjit singh returned to capture peshawar and was met by the armies of azim khan at nowshera following the sikh victory at the battle of nowshera ranjit singh recaptured peshawar rather than reappointing jehandad khan of khattak ranjit singh selected yar muhammad khan to once again rule the region the sikh empire annexed the khyber pakhtunkhwa region following advances from the armies of hari singh nalwa an 1835 attempt by dost muhammad khan to reoccupy peshawar failed when his army declined to engage in combat with the dal khalsa dost muhammad khans son mohammad akbar khan engaged with sikh forces the battle of jamrud of 1837 and failed to recapture it during sikh rule an italian named paolo avitabile was appointed an administrator of peshawar and is remembered for having unleashed a reign of fear there the citys famous mahabat khan built in 1630 in the jewellers bazaar was badly damaged and desecrated by the sikhs who also rebuilt the bala hissar fort during their occupation of peshawar british east india company defeated the sikhs during the second anglosikh war in 1849 and incorporated small parts of the region into the province of punjab while peshawar was the site of a small revolt against british during the mutiny of 1857 local pashtun tribes throughout the region generally remained neutral or supportive of the british as they detested the sikhs in contrast to other parts of british india which rose up in revolt against the british however british control of parts of the region was routinely challenged by wazir tribesmen in waziristan and other pashtun tribes who resisted any foreign occupation until pakistan was created by the late 19th century the official boundaries of khyber pakhtunkhwa region still had not been defined as the region was still claimed by the kingdom of afghanistan it was only in 1893 the british demarcated the boundary with afghanistan under a treaty agreed to by the afghan king abdur rahman khan following the second angloafghan war several princely states within the boundaries of the region were allowed to maintain their autonomy under the terms of maintaining friendly ties with the british as the british war effort during world war one demanded the reallocation of resources from british india to the european war fronts some tribesmen from afghanistan crossed the durand line in 1917 to attack british posts in an attempt to gain territory and weaken the legitimacy of the border the validity of the durand line however was reaffirmed in 1919 by the afghan government with the signing of the treaty of rawalpindi which ended the third angloafghan war – a war in which waziri tribesmen allied themselves with the forces of afghanistans king amanullah in their resistance to british rule the wazirs and other tribes taking advantage of instability on the frontier continued to resist british occupation until 1920 – even after afghanistan had signed a peace treaty with the british british campaigns to subdue tribesmen along the durand line as well as three angloafghan wars made travel between afghanistan and the densely populated heartlands of khyber pakhtunkhwa increasingly difficult the two regions were largely isolated from one another from the start of the second angloafghan war in 1878 until the start of world war ii in 1939 when conflict along the afghan frontier largely dissipated concurrently the british continued their large public works projects in the region and extended the great indian peninsula railway into the region which connected the modern khyber pakhtunkhwa region to the plains of india to the east other projects such as the attock bridge islamia college university khyber railway and establishment of cantonments in peshawar kohat mardan and nowshera further cemented british rule in the region in 1901 the british carved out the northwest portions of punjab province to create the northwest frontier province nwfp which was renamed khyber pakhtunkhwa in 2010 during this period northwest frontier province was a scene of repeated outrages on hindus during the independence period there was a congressled ministry in the province which was led by secular pashtun leaders including bacha khan who preferred joining india instead of pakistan the secular pashtun leadership was also of the view that if joining india was not an option then they should espouse the cause of an independent ethnic pashtun state rather than pakistan in june 1947 mirzali khan bacha khan and other khudai khidmatgars declared the bannu resolution demanding that the pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of pashtunistan composing all pashtun majority territories of british india instead of being made to join the new state of pakistan however the british raj refused to comply with the demand of this resolution as their departure from the region required regions under their control to choose either to join india or pakistan with no third option by 1947 pashtun nationalists were advocating for a united india and no prominent voices advocated for a union with afghanistan the secular stance of bacha khan had driven a wedge between the ulama of the otherwise procongress and proindian unity jamiat ulema hind juh and bacha khans khudai khidmatgars there were other tensions in the area as well particularly those that involved agitations by pashtun tribesmen against the imperial government for example in 1936 a british indian court ruled against the marriage of a hindu girl allegedly converted to islam in bannu after the girls family filed a case of abduction and forced conversion the ruling was based on the fact that the girl was a minor and was asked to make her decision of conversion and marriage after she reaches the age of majority till then she was asked to live with a third party after the girls family filed a case the court ruled in the familys favour angering the local muslims who had later gone on to lead attacks against the bannu brigade such controversies stirred up antihindu sentiments amongst the provinces muslim population by 1947 the majority of the ulama in the province began supporting the muslim leagues idea of pakistan immediately prior to 1947 partition of india the british held a referendum in the nwfp to allow voters to choose between joining india or pakistan the polling began on 6 july 1947 and the referendum results were made public on 20 july 1947 according to the official results there were 572798 registered voters out of which 289244 9902 votes were cast in favour of pakistan while 2874 098 were cast in favour of india the muslim league declared the results as valid since over half of all eligible voters backed the merger with pakistan the then chief minister dr khan sahib along with his brother bacha khan and the khudai khidmatgars boycotted the referendum citing that it did not have the options of the nwfp becoming independent or joining afghanistan their appeal for boycott had an effect as according to an estimate the total turnout for the referendum was 15 lower than the total turnout in the 1946 elections although over half of all eligible voters backed merger with pakistan bacha khan pledged allegiance to the new state of pakistan in 1947 and thereafter abandoned his goals of an independent pashtunistan and a united india in favour of supporting increased autonomy for the nwfp within pakistan he was subsequently arrested several times for his opposition to the strong centralized rule he later claimed that pashtunistan was never a reality the idea of pashtunistan never helped pashtuns and it only caused suffering for them he further claimed that the successive governments of afghanistan only exploited the idea for their own political goals there had been tensions between pakistan and afghanistan ever since afghanistan voted against pakistans inclusion in the united nations in 1948 after the creation of pakistan in 1947 afghanistan was the sole member of the united nations to vote against pakistans accession to the un because of kabuls claim to the pashtun territories on the pakistani side of the durand line afghanistans loya jirga of 1949 declared the durand line invalid this led to border tensions with pakistan afghanistans governments have periodically refused to recognize pakistans inheritance of british treaties regarding the region as had been agreed to by the afghan governments following the second angloafghan war and after the treaty ending third angloafghan war no option was available to cede the territory to the afghans even though afghanistan continued to claim the entire region as it was part of the durrani empire prior the conquest of the region by the sikhs in 1818 during the 1950s afghanistan supported the pushtunistan movement a secessionist movement that failed to gain substantial support amongst the tribes of the northwest frontier province afghanistans refusal to recognize the durrand line and its subsequent support for the pashtunistan movement has been cited as the main cause of tensions between the two countries that have existed since pakistans independence after the afghansoviet war khyber pakhtunkhwa has become one of the areas of top focus for the war against terror the province has been reported to struggle with the issues of crumbling schools nonexistent healthcare and lack of any sound infrastructure while areas such as islamabad and rawalpindi receive priority funding in 2010 the name of the province changed to khyber pakhtunkhwa protests arose among the locals of the hazara division due to this name change as they began to demand their own province seven people were killed and 100 injured in protests on 11 april 2011 khyber pakhtunkhwa sits primarily on the iranian plateau and comprises the junction where the slopes of the hindu kush mountains on the eurasian plate give way to the induswatered hills approaching south asia this situation has led to seismic activity in the past the famous khyber pass links the province to afghanistan while the kohalla bridge in circle bakote abbottabad is a major crossing point over the jhelum river in the east geographically the province could be divided into two zones the northern zone extending from the ranges of the hindu kush to the borders of the peshawar basin and the southern zone extending from peshawar to the derajat basin the northern zone is cold and snowy in winters with heavy rainfall and pleasant summers with the exception of the peshawar basin which is hot in summer and cold in winter it has moderate rainfallcitation needed the southern zone is arid with hot summers and relatively cold winters and scanty rainfall the sheikh badin hills a spur of clay and sandstone hills that stretch east from the sulaiman mountains to the indus river separates dera ismail khan district from the marwat plains of the lakki marwat the highest peak in the range is the limestone sheikh badin mountain which is protected by the sheikh badin national park near the indus river the terminus of the sheikh badin hills is a spur of limestone hills known as the kafir kot hills where the ancient hindu complex of kafir kot is located the major rivers that crisscross the province are kabul swat chitral kunar siran panjkora bara kurram dor haroo gomal and zhob its snowcapped peaks and lush green valleys of unusual beauty have enormous potential for tourism the climate of khyber pakhtunkhwa varies immensely for a region of its size encompassing most of the many climate types found in pakistan the province stretching southwards from the baroghil pass in the hindu kush covers almost six degrees of latitude it is mainly a mountainous region dera ismail khan is one of the hottest places in south asia while in the mountains to the north the weather is mild in the summer and intensely cold in the winter the air is generally very dry consequently the daily and annual range of temperature is quite large rainfall also varies widely although large parts of khyber pakhtunkhwa are typically dry the province also contains the wettest parts of pakistan in its eastern fringe especially in monsoon season from midjune to midseptember chitral district due to its location is completely sheltered from the monsoon that controls the weather in eastern pakistan owing to its relatively westerly location and the shielding effect of the nanga parbat massif in many ways chitral district has more in common regarding climate with central asia than south asia the winters are generally cold even in the valleys and heavy snow during the winter blocks passes and isolates the region in the valleys however summers can be hotter than on the windward side of the mountains due to lower cloud cover chitral can reach 40\\xa0°c 104\\xa0°f frequently during this period however the humidity is extremely low during these hot spells and as a result the summer climate is less torrid than in the rest of the indian subcontinent most precipitation falls as thunderstorms or snow during winter and spring so that the climate at the lowest elevations is classed as mediterranean csa continental mediterranean dsa or semiarid bsk summers are extremely dry in the north of chitral district and receive only a little rain in the south around drosh at elevations above 5000 metres 16400\\xa0ft as much as a third of the snow which feeds the large karakoram and hindukush glaciers comes from the monsoon since these elevations are too high to be shielded from its moisture on the southern flanks of nanga parbat and in upper and lower dir districts rainfall is much heavier than further north because moist winds from the arabian sea are able to penetrate the region when they collide with the mountain slopes winter depressions provide heavy precipitation the monsoon although short is generally powerful as a result the southern slopes of khyber pakhtunkhwa are the wettest part of pakistan annual rainfall ranges from around 500 millimetres 20\\xa0in in the most sheltered areas to as much as 1750 millimetres 69\\xa0in in parts of abbottabad and mansehra districts this regions climate is classed at lower elevations as humid subtropical cfa in the west cwa in the east whilst at higher elevations with a southerly aspect it becomes classed as humid continental dfb however accurate data for altitudes above 2000 metres 6560\\xa0ft are practically nonexistent here in chitral or in the south of the province the seasonality of rainfall in central khyber pakhtunkhwa shows very marked gradients from east to west at dir march remains the wettest month due to frequent frontal cloud bands whereas in hazara more than half the rainfall comes from the monsoon this creates a unique situation characterized by a bimodal rainfall regime which extends into the southern part of the province described below since cold air from the siberian high loses its chilling capacity upon crossing the vast karakoram and himalaya ranges winters in central khyber pakhtunkhwa are somewhat milder than in chitral snow remains very frequent at high altitudes but rarely lasts long on the ground in the major towns and agricultural valleys outside of winter temperatures in central khyber pakhtunkhwa are not so hot as in chitralcitation needed significantly higher humidity when the monsoon is active means that heat discomfort can be greater however even during the most humid periods the high altitudes typically allow for some relief from the heat overnight as one moves further away from the foothills of the himalaya and karakoram ranges the climate changes from the humid subtropical climate of the foothills to the typically arid climate of sindh balochistan and southern punjab as in central khyber pakhtunkhwa the seasonality of precipitation shows a very sharp gradient from west to east but the whole region very rarely receives significant monsoon rainfall even at high elevations annual rainfall is less than 400 millimetres 16\\xa0in and in some places as little as 200 millimetres 8\\xa0in temperatures in southern khyber pakhtunkhwa are extremely hot dera ismail khan in the southernmost district of the province is known as one of the hottest places in the world with temperatures known to have reached 50\\xa0°c 122\\xa0°f in the cooler months nights can be cold and frosts remain frequent snow is very rare and daytime temperatures remain comfortably warm with abundant sunshine there are about 29 national

in the province elected one of pakistans only religiously based provincial governments led by the ultraconservative muttahida majliseamal mma during the administration of president pervez musharraf the american involvement in neighbouring afghanistan contributed towards the electoral victory of the islamic coalition led by jamaateislami pakistan jei whose social policies made the province a groundswell of antiamericanism the electoral victory of mma was also in context of guided democracy in the musharraff administration that barred the mainstream political parties the leftist pakistan peoples party and the centreright pakistan muslim league n pmln whose chairmen and presidents having been barred from participation in the elections policy enforcement of a range of social restrictions though the implementation of strict shariah was introduced by the muttahida majliseamal government the law was never fully enacted due to objections of the governor of khyber pakhtunkhwa

enforce gender segregation in the provinces educational institutions the coalition further tried to prohibit male doctors from performing ultrasounds on women and tried to close the provinces cinemas in 2005 the coalition successfully passed the prohibition of use of women in photograph bill 2005 leading to the removal of all public advertisements that featured women at the height of taliban insurgency in pakistan the religious coalition lost its grip in the general elections held in 2008 and the religious coalition was swept out of power by the leftist awami national party which also witnessed the resignation of president musharraf in 2008 the anp government eventually led the initiatives to repeal the major islamists social programs with the backing of the federal government led by ppp in islamabad public disapproval of anps leftist program integrated in civil administration with the sounded allegations of corruption as well as popular opposition against religious program promoted by the mma swiftly shifted the provinces leniency away from the left in 2012 in 2013 the provincial politics shifted towards populism and nationalism when the pti led by imran khan was able to form the minority government in coalition with the jei the province now serves as the stronghold of the pti and is perceived as one of the more right wing areas of the country after the 2018

region of the country sindh is the thirdlargest province of pakistan by land area and the secondlargest province by population after punjab it is bordered by the pakistani provinces of balochistan to the west and northwest and punjab to the north it shares an international border with the indian states of gujarat and rajasthan to the east it is also bounded by the arabian sea to the south sindhs landscape consists mostly of alluvial plains flanking the indus river the thar desert in the eastern portion of the province along the international border with india and the kirthar mountains in the western portion of the province the economy of sindh is the secondlargest in pakistan after the province of punjab its provincial capital of karachi is the most populous city in the country as well as

for the overwhelming majority of muhajirs lit\\u2009migrants a multiethnic group of indian muslims who migrated to the region after the partition of british india in 1947 the province is well known for its distinct culture which is strongly influenced by sufist islam an important marker of sindhi identity for both hindus and muslims sindh is prominent for its history during the bronze age under the indus valley civilization and is home to two unescodesignated world heritage sites the makli necropolis and mohenjodaro the greeks who conquered sindh in 325 bce under the command of alexander the great referred to the indus river as indós hence the modern indus the ancient iranians referred to everything east of the river indus as hind the word sindh is a persian derivative of the sanskrit term sindhu meaning river  a reference to indus river southworth suggests that the name sindhu is in turn derived from cintu a dravidian word for date palm a tree commonly found in sindh the previous spelling sind from the persoarabic سند was discontinued in 1988 by an amendment passed in sindh assembly and is now spelt sindh sindh and surrounding areas contain the ruins of the indus valley civilization there are remnants of thousandyearold cities and structures with a notable example in sindh being that of mohenjo daro built around 2500 bce it was one of the largest settlements of the ancient indus civilisation with features such as standardized bricks street grids and covered sewerage systems it was one of the worlds earliest major cities contemporaneous with the civilizations of ancient egypt mesopotamia minoan crete and caralsupe mohenjodaro was abandoned in the 19th century bce as the indus valley civilization declined and the site was not rediscovered until the 1920s significant excavation has since been conducted at the site of the city which was designated a unesco world heritage site in 1980 the site is currently threatened by erosion and improper restoration a gradual drying of the region during the 3rd\\xa0millennium bce may have been the initial stimulus for its urbanisation eventually it also reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisations demise and to disperse its population to the eastb during the bronze age the territory of sindh was known as sindhusauvīra covering the lower indus valley with its southern border being the indian ocean and its northern border being the pañjāb around multān the capital of sindhusauvīra was named roruka and vītabhaya or vītībhaya and corresponds to the mediaeval arohṛ and the modernday rohṛī the achaemenids conquered the region and established the satrapy of hindush the territory may have corresponded to the area covering the lower and central indus basin present day sindh and the southern punjab regions of pakistan alternatively some authors consider that hindush may have been located in the punjab area these areas remained under persian control until the invasion by alexander alexander conquered parts of sindh after punjab for few years and appointed his general peithon as governor he constructed a harbour at the city of patala in sindh chandragupta maurya fought alexanders successor in the east seleucus i nicator when the latter invaded in a peace treaty seleucus ceded all territories west of the indus river and offered a marriage including a portion of bactria while chandragupta granted seleucus 500 elephants following a century of mauryan rule which ended by 180 bce the region came under the indogreeks followed by the indo scythians who ruled with their capital at minnagara later on sasanian rulers from the reign of shapur i claimed control of the sindh area in their inscriptions known as hind the local rai dynasty emerged from sindh and reigned for a period of 144 years concurrent with the huna invasions of north india aror was noted to be the capital the brahmin dynasty of sindh succeeded the rai dynasty most of the information about its existence comes from the chach nama a historical account of the chachbrahmin dynasty after the empires fall in 712 though the empire had ended its dynastys members administered parts of sindh under the umayyad caliphates caliphal province of sind after the death of the islamic prophet muhammad the arab expansion towards the east reached the sindh region beyond persia the connection between the sindh and islam was established by the initial muslim invasions during the rashidun caliphate alhakim ibn jabalah alabdi who attacked makran in the year 649 ce was an early partisan of ali ibn abu talib during the caliphate of ali many jats of sindh had come under the influence of shiism and some even participated in the battle of camel and died fighting for ali under the umayyads 661–750 ce many shias sought asylum in the region of sindh to live in relative peace in the remote area ziyad hindi is one of those refugees the first clash with the hindu kings of sindh took place in 636 15 ah under caliph umar ibn alkhattab with the governor of bahrain uthman ibn abualaas dispatching naval expeditions against thane and bharuch and debal albaladhuri states they were victorious at debal but doesnt mention the results of other two raids however the chach nama states that the raid of debal was defeated and its governor killed the leader of the raids these raids were thought to be triggered by a later pirate attack on umayyad ships baladhuri adds that this stopped any more incursions until the reign of uthman in 712 mohammed bin qasim defeated the brahmin dynasty and annexed it to the umayyad caliphate this marked the beginning of islam in the indian subcontinent the habbari dynasty ruled much of greater sindh as a semiindependent emirate from 854 to 1024 beginning with the rule of umar bin abdul aziz alhabbari in 854 ce the region became semiindependent from the abbasid caliphate in 861 while continuing to nominally pledge allegiance to the abbasid caliph in baghdad the habbaris ruled sindh until they were defeated by sultan mahmud ghaznavi in 1026 who then went on to destroy the old habbari capital of mansura and annex the region to the ghaznavid empire thereby ending arab rule of sindh the soomra dynasty was a local sindhi muslim dynasty that ruled between early 11th century and the 14th century later chroniclers like ali ibn alathir c late 12th c and ibn khaldun c late 14th c attributed the fall of habbarids to mahmud of ghazni lending credence to the argument of hafif being the last habbarid the soomras appear to have established themselves as a regional power in this power vacuum the ghurids and ghaznavids continued to rule parts of sindh across the eleventh and early twelfth century alongside soomrus the precise delineations are not yet known but sommrus were probably centered in lower sindh some of them were adherents of ismailism one of their kings shimuddin chamisar had submitted to iltutmish the sultan of delhi and was allowed to continue on as a vassal the sammas overthrew the soomras soon after 1335 and the last soomra ruler took shelter with the governor of gujarat under the protection of muhammad bin tughluq the sultan of delhi mohammad bin tughlaq made an expedition against sindh in 1351 and died at sondha possibly in an attempt to restore the soomras with this the sammas became independent the next sultan firuz shah tughlaq attacked sindh in 1365 and 1367 unsuccessfully but with reinforcements from delhi he later obtained banbhiniyos surrender for a period the sammas were therefore subject to delhi again later as the sultanate of delhi collapsed they became fully independent jam unar was the founder of samma dynasty mentioned by ibn battuta the samma civilization contributed significantly to the evolution of the indoislamic architectural style thatta is famous for its necropolis which covers 10 square km on the makli hill it has left its mark in sindh with magnificent structures including the makli necropolis of its royals in thatta they were later overthrown by the turkic arghuns in the late 15th century in the late 16th century sindh was brought into the mughal empire by akbar himself born in the rajputana kingdom in umerkot in sindh mughal rule from their provincial capital of thatta was to last in lower sindh until the early 18th century while upper sindh was ruled by the indigenous kalhora dynasty holding power consolidating their rule from their capital of khudabad before shifting to hyderabad from 1768 onwards the talpurs succeeded the kalhoras and four branches of the dynasty were established one ruled lower sindh from the city of hyderabad another ruled over upper sindh from the city of khairpur a third ruled around the eastern city of mirpur khas and a fourth was based in tando muhammad khan they were ethnically baloch and for most of their rule they were subordinate to the durrani empire and were forced to pay tribute to them they ruled from 1783 until 1843 when they were in turn defeated by the british at the battle of miani and battle of dubbo  the northern khairpur branch of the talpur dynasty however continued to maintain a degree of sovereignty during british rule as the princely state of khairpur whose ruler elected to join the new dominion of pakistan in october 1947 as an autonomous region before being fully amalgamated into west pakistan in 1955 the british conquered sindh in 1843 general charles napier is said to have reported victory to the governor general with a oneword telegram namely peccavi – or i have sinned latin the british had two objectives in their rule of sindh the consolidation of british rule and the use of sindh as a market for british products and a source of revenue and raw materials with the appropriate infrastructure in place the british hoped to utilise sindh for its economic potential the british incorporated sindh some years later after annexing it into the bombay presidency distance from the provincial capital bombay led to grievances that sindh was neglected in contrast to other parts of the presidency the merger of sindh into punjab province was considered from time to time but was turned down because of british disagreement and sindhi opposition both from muslims and hindus to being annexed to punjab later desire for a separate administrative status for sindh grew at the annual session of the indian national congress in 1913 a sindhi hindu put forward the demand for sindhs separation from the bombay presidency on the grounds of sindhs unique cultural character this reflected the desire of sindhs predominantly hindu commercial class to free itself from competing with the more powerful bombays business interests meanwhile sindhi politics was characterised in the 1920s by the growing importance of karachi and the khilafat movement a number of sindhi pirs descendants of sufi saints who had proselytised in sindh joined the khilafat movement which propagated the protection of the ottoman caliphate and those pirs who did not join the movement found a decline in their following the pirs generated huge support for the khilafat cause in sindh sindh came to be at the forefront of the khilafat movement although sindh had a cleaner record of communal harmony than other parts of india the provinces muslim elite and emerging muslim middle class demanded separation of sindh from bombay presidency as a safeguard for their own interests in this campaign local sindhi muslims identified hindu with bombay instead of sindh sindhi hindus were seen as representing the interests of bombay instead of the majority of sindhi muslims sindhi hindus for the most part opposed the separation of sindh from bombay although sindh had a culture of religious syncretism communal harmony and tolerance due to sindhs strong sufi culture in which both sindhi muslims and sindhi hindus partook both the muslim landed elite waderas and the hindu commercial elements banias collaborated in oppressing the predominantly muslim peasantry of sindh who were economically exploited sindhi muslims eventually demanded the separation of sindh from the bombay presidency a move opposed by sindhi hindus in sindhs first provincial election after its separation from bombay in 1936 economic interests were an essential factor of politics informed by religious and cultural issues due to british policies much land in sindh was transferred from muslim to hindu hands over the decades religious tensions rose in sindh over the sukkur manzilgah issue where muslims and hindus disputed over an abandoned mosque in proximity to an area sacred to hindus the sindh muslim league exploited the issue and agitated for the return of the mosque to muslims consequentially a thousand members of the muslim league were imprisoned eventually due to panic the government restored the mosque to muslimsthe separation of sindh from bombay presidency triggered sindhi muslim nationalists to support the pakistan movement even while the punjab and northwest frontier province were ruled by parties hostile to the muslim league sindh remained loyal to jinnah although the prominent sindhi muslim nationalist gm syed left the all india muslim league in the mid1940s and his relationship with jinnah never improved the overwhelming majority of sindhi muslims supported the creation of pakistan seeing in it their deliverance  sindhi support for the pakistan movement arose from the desire of the sindhi muslim business class to drive out their hindu competitors the muslim leagues rise to becoming the party with the strongest support in sindh was in large part linked to its winning over of the religious pir families although the muslim league had previously fared poorly in the 1937 elections in sindh when local sindhi muslim parties won more seats the muslim leagues cultivation of support from local pirs in 1946 helped it gain a foothold in the province it didnt take long for the overwhelming majority of sindhi muslims to campaign for the creation of pakistan in 1947 violence did not constitute a major part of the sindhi partition experience unlike in punjab there were very few incidents of violence on sindh in part due to the sufiinfluenced culture of religious tolerance and in part that sindh was not divided and was instead made part of pakistan in its entirety sindhi hindus who left generally did so out of a fear of persecution rather than persecution itself because of the arrival of muslim refugees from india sindhi hindus differentiated between the local sindhi muslims and the migrant muslims from india a large number of sindhi hindus travelled to india by sea to the ports of bombay porbandar veraval and okha sindh has the second highest human development index out of all of pakistans provinces at 0628 the 2017 census of pakistan indicated a population of 479 million the major ethnic group of the province is the sindhis but there is also a significant presence of other groups sindhis of baloch origin make up about 30 of the total sindhi population although they speak sindhi or saraiki as their native tongue while urduspeaking muhajirs make up over 19 of the total population of the province while punjabi are 10 and pashtuns represent 7citation needed religion in sindh according to 2017 census islam in sindh has a long history starting with the capture of sindh by muhammad bin qasim in 712 ce over time the majority of the population in sindh converted to islam especially in rural areas today muslims make up over 90 of the population and are more dominant in urban than rural areas islam in sindh has a strong sufi ethos with numerous muslim saints and mystics such as the sufi poet shah abdul latif bhittai having lived in sindh historically one popular legend which highlights the strong sufi presence in sindh is that 125000 sufi saints and mystics are buried on makli hill near thatta the development of sufism in sindh was similar to the development of sufism in other parts of the muslim world in the 16th century two sufi tareeqat orders – qadria and naqshbandia – were introduced in sindh sufism continues to play an important role in the daily lives of sindhis in 1941 the last census conducted prior to the partition of india the total population of sindh was 4535008 out of which 3208325 708 were muslims 1229926

population roughly around 42 million people and 133 of the provinces rural population as per 2017 pakistani census report these numbers also include the scheduled caste population which stands at 17

plenty of dust throughout the year except for rainy season vehicles and industries also contribute to air pollution greenhouse gas emissions and global warming there is a lot of noise pollution due to traffic land pollution is due to solid trash not disposed to dedicated dumping sites trash is seen here and there and sometimes everywhere lastly there is water pollution in lyari and malir rivers as gutters directly open into these rivers these rivers than directly go into arabian sea untreated so sewerage and industrial wastewater is directly being thrown into indian ocean hence polluting it and destroying marine life under the sea 3 waste water treatment plants exist but are all dysfunctional size of drainage system and storm water drains locally known as naalahs in the city is not enough to

introduced in the karachi gymkhana and the boat club neorenaissance architecture was popular in the 19th century and was the architectural style for st josephs convent 1870 and the sind club 1883 the classical style made a comeback in the late 19th century as seen in lady dufferin hospital 1898 and the cantt railway station while italianate buildings remained popular an eclectic blend termed indosaracenic or anglomughal began to emerge in some locations\\nthe local mercantile community began acquiring impressive structures zaibunnisa street in the saddar area known as elphinstone street in british days is an example where the mercantile groups adopted the italianate and indosaracenic style to demonstrate their familiarity with western culture and their own the hindu gymkhana 1925 and mohatta palace are examples of mughal revival buildings the sindh wildlife conservation building located in saddar served as a freemasonic lodge until it was taken over by the government there are talks of it being taken away from this custody and being renovated and the lodge being preserved with its original woodwork and ornate wooden staircase indus valley school of art and architecture is one of the prime examples of architectural conservation and restoration where an entire nusserwanjee building from kharadar area of karachi has been relocated to clifton for adaptive reuse in an art

largest in the world with a population of over 13 million it is situated in the northeast of the country with river ravi flowing northwest of the city it is the capital of the province of punjab where it is the largest city lahore is one of pakistans major industrial and economic hubs it has been the historic capital and cultural centre of the wider punjab region and is one of pakistans most socially liberal progressive and cosmopolitan cities lahores origins reach into antiquity the city has been inhabited for at least two millennia although it rose to prominence in the 10th century lahore was the capital of multiple empires throughout its history including the hindu shahis ghaznavids and delhi sultanate in the medieval era lahore reached the height of its splendor under the mughal empire between the late 16th and early 18th century and served as its capital city for many years during this period it was one of the largest cities in the medieval world the city was captured by the forces of the afsharid ruler nader shah in 1739 although the mughal authority was reestablished it fell into a period of decay while being contested among the afghans and the sikhs between 1748 and 1798 lahore eventually became the capital of the sikh empire in the early 19th century regaining some of its lost grandeur lahore was annexed to the british raj in 1849 and became the capital of british punjab lahore was central to the independence movements of both india and pakistan with the city being the site of both the declaration of indian independence and the resolution calling for the establishment of pakistan it experienced some of the worst riotings during the partition period preceding pakistans independence following the success of the pakistan movement and the subsequent

much of pakistans tourist industry with major attractions including the walled city the famous badshahi and wazir khan mosques as well as several sikh and sufi shrines lahore is also home to the lahore fort and shalimar gardens both of which are unesco world heritage sites the origin of lahores name is unclear the citys name has been variously recorded by early muslim historians as luhawar lūhār and rahwar the iranian polymath and geographer abu rayhan albiruni referred to the city as luhāwar in his 11th century work qanun while the poet amir khusrow who lived during the delhi sultanate period recorded the citys name as lāhanūr yaqut alhamawi records the citys name as lawhūr mentioning that it was famously known as lahāwar persian historian firishta mentions the city as alahwar in his work with alahwar being another variation one theory suggests that lahores name is a corruption of the word ravāwar as r to l shifts are common in languages derived from sanskrit ravāwar is the simplified pronunciation of the name iravatyāwar a name possibly derived from the ravi river known as the iravati river in the vedas another theory suggests the citys name may derive from the word lohar meaning blacksmith according to a legend lahores name derives from lavpur or lavapuri city of lava and is said to have been founded by prince lava the son of sita and rama the same account attributes the founding of nearby kasur to his twin brother kusha though it was actually established in the 16th century no definitive records of lahores early history exist and lahores ambiguous historical background has given rise to various theories about its establishment and history hindu legend states that keneksen the founder of the solar dynasty migrated out from the city early records of lahore are scant but alexander the greats historians make no mention of any city near lahores location during his invasion in 326 bce suggesting the city had not been founded by that point or was unnoteworthy ptolemy mentions in his geography a city called labokla situated near the chenab and ravi rivers which may have been in reference to ancient lahore or an abandoned predecessor of the city chinese pilgrim xuanzang gave a vivid description of a large and prosperous unnamed city that may have been lahore when he visited the region in 630 ce during his tour of india xuanzang described the city then under taank rule as a great brahmin city the first document that mentions lahore by name is the hudud alalam the regions of the world written in 982 ce in which lahore is mentioned as a town which had impressive temples large markets and huge orchards lahore previously a town first emerged as a notable city in 11th century during the era of sufi saint ali alhajvery few other references to lahore remain from before its capture by the ghaznavid sultan mahmud of ghazni in the 11th century during this time lahore appears to have served as the capital of northeast punjab under anandapala of the kabul shahi empire who moved the capital there from waihind the capital would later be moved to sialkot following ghaznavid incursions until sialkot was also conquered by the ghaznavids sultan mahmud of ghazni captured lahore somewhere in 1020–1027 under ghaznavid rule lahore emerged effectively as the empires second capital in 1021 sultan mahmud appointed malik ayaz to the throne of lahore—a governorship of the ghaznavid empire the city was captured by nialtigin the rebellious muslim governor of multan in 1034 although his forces were expelled by malik ayaz in 1036 with the support of sultan ibrahim ghaznavi malik ayaz rebuilt and repopulated the city which had been devastated after the ghaznavid invasion ayaz erected city walls and a masonry fort built in 1037–1040 on the ruins of the previous one which had been demolished during the ghaznavid invasion a confederation of hindu princes then unsuccessfully laid siege to lahore in 1043–44 during ayaz rule the city became a cultural and academic centre renowned for poetry under ayaz reign lahore was formally made the eastern capital of the ghaznavid empire in 1152 under the reign of khusrau shah the city then became the sole capital of the ghaznavid empire in 1163 after the fall of ghazni under their patronage poets and scholars from kashgar bukhara samarkand baghdad nishapur amol and ghazni congregated in lahore the entire city of lahore during the medieval ghaznavid era was probably located west of the modern shah alami bazaar and north of the bhatti gate following the siege of lahore in 1186 the ghurid ruler muhammad of ghor captured the city and imprisoned the last ghaznavid ruler khusrau malik thus ending ghaznavid rule over lahore lahore was made an important establishment of the mamluk dynasty of the delhi sultanate following the assassination of muhammad of ghor in 1206 under the reign of mamluk sultan qutb uddin aibak lahore attracted poets and scholars from turkestan greater khorasan persia and mesopotamia lahore at this time had more poets writing in persian than any city in persia or khorasan following the death of aibak lahore was disputed among ghurid officers the city first came under the control of the governor of multan nasir addin qabacha before being briefly captured by the sultan of the mamluks in delhi iltutmish in 1217 in an alliance with local khokhars in 1223 jalal aldin mangburni of the khwarazmian dynasty of modernday uzbekistan captured lahore after fleeing genghis khans invasion of khwarazm jalal addin then fled from lahore to capture the city of uch sharif after iltutmishs armies recaptured lahore in 1228 the threat of mongol invasions and political instability in lahore caused future sultans to regard delhi as a safer capital for medieval islamic india even though delhi was considered a forward base whereas lahore was widely considered the centre of islamic culture in northeastern punjab lahore came under progressively weaker central rule under iltutmishs descendants in delhi to the point that governors in the city acted with great autonomy under the rule of kabir khan ayaz lahore was virtually independent from the delhi sultanate lahore was sacked and ruined by the mongol army in 1241 lahore governor malik ikhtyaruddin qaraqash fled the mongols while the mongols held the city for a few years under the rule of the mongol chief toghrul in 1266 sultan balban reconquered lahore but in 1287 under the mongol ruler temür khan the mongols again overran northern punjab because of mongol invasions the lahore region had become a city on a frontier with the regions administrative centre shifted south to dipalpur the mongols again invaded northern punjab in 1298 though their advance was eventually stopped by ulugh khan brother of sultan alauddin khalji of delhi the mongols again attacked lahore in 1305 lahore briefly flourished again under the reign of ghiyath aldin tughlaq ghazi malik of the tughluq dynasty between 1320 and 1325 though the city was again sacked in 1329 by tarmashirin of the central asian chagatai khanate and then again by the mongol chief hülechü khokhars seized lahore in 1342 but the city was retaken by ghazi maliks son muhammad bin tughluq the weakened city then fell into obscurity and was captured once more by the khokhars in 1394 by the time the mongol conqueror timur captured the city in 1398 from  shaikha khokhar he did not loot it because it was no longer wealthy timur gave control of the lahore region to khizr khan governor of multan who later established the sayyid dynasty in 1414 – the fourth dynasty of the delhi sultanate lahore was briefly occupied by the timurid governor of kabul in 1432–33 lahore began to be incurred upon yet again the khokhar tribe and so the city was granted to bahlul lodi in 1441 by the sayyid dynasty in delhi though lodi would then displace the sayyids in 1451 by establishing himself upon the throne of delhi bahlul lodi installed his cousin tatar khan to be governor of the city though tatar khan died in battle with sikandar lodi in 1485 governorship of lahore was transferred by sikandar lodi to umar khan sarwani who quickly left the management of this city to his son said khan sarwani said khan was removed from power in 1500 by sikandar lodi and lahore came under the governorship of daulat khan lodi son of tatar khan and former employer of guru nanak the founder of sikhism badshahi mosque lahore fort tomb of jahangir shahi hammam babur the founder of the mughal empire captured and sacked lahore and dipalpur although he retreated after the lodi nobles backed away from assisting him the city became a refuge to humayun and his cousin kamran mirza when sher shah suri rose in power on the gangetic plains displacing mughal power sher shah suri continued to rise in power and seized lahore in 1540 though humayun reconquered lahore in february 1555 the establishment of mughal rule eventually led to the most prosperous era of lahores history lahores prosperity and central position has yielded more mughalera monuments in lahore than either delhi or agra by the time of the rule of the mughal empires greatest emperors a majority of lahores residents did not live within the walled city itself but instead lived in suburbs that had spread outside the citys walls only 9 of the 36 urban quarters around lahore known as guzars were located within the city walls during the akbar period during this period lahore was closely tied to smaller market towns known as qasbahs such as kasur and eminabad as well as amritsar and batala in modernday india which in turn linked to supply chains in villages surrounding each qasbah beginning in 1584 lahore became the mughal capital when akbar began refortifying the citys ruined citadel laying the foundations for the revival of the lahore fort akbar made lahore one of his original twelve subah provinces and in 1585–86 relegated governorship of the city and subah to bhagwant das brother of mariamuzzamani who was commonly known as jodhabhai akbar also rebuilt the citys walls and extended their perimeter east of the shah alami bazaar to encompass the sparsely populated area of rarra maidan the akbari mandi grain market was set up during this era which continues to function to the presentday akbar also established the dharampura neighbourhood in the early 1580s which survives today the earliest of lahores many havelis date from the akbari era lahores mughal monuments were built under the reign of akbar and several subsequent emperors lahore reached its cultural zenith during this period with dozens of mosques tombs shrines and urban infrastructure developed in the city during the reign of emperor jahangir in the early 17th century lahores bazaars were noted to be vibrant frequented by foreigners and stocked with a wide array of goods in 1606 jehangirs rebel son khusrau mirza laid siege to lahore after obtaining the blessings of the sikh guru arjan dev jehangir quickly defeated his son at bhairowal and the roots of mughal–sikh animosity grew sikh guru arjan dev was executed in lahore in 1606 for his involvement in the rebellion emperor jahangir chose to be buried in lahore and his tomb was built in lahores shahdara bagh suburb in 1637 by his wife nur jahan whose tomb is also nearby jahangirs son shah jahan reigned 1628–1658 was born in lahore in 1592 he renovated large portions of the lahore fort with luxurious white marble and erected the iconic naulakha pavilion in 1633 shah jahan lavished lahore with some of its most celebrated and iconic monuments such as the shahi hammam in 1635 and both the shalimar gardens and the extravagantly decorated wazir khan mosque in 1641 the population of premodern lahore probably reached its zenith during his reign with suburban districts home to perhaps 6 times as many compared to within the walled city shah jahans son aurangzeb last of the great mughal emperors further contributed to the development of lahore aurangzeb built the alamgiri bund embankment along the ravi river in 1662 in order to prevent its shifting course from threatening the citys walls the area near the embankment grew into a fashionable locality with several nearby pleasure gardens laid by lahores gentry the largest of lahores mughal monuments the badshahi mosque was raised during aurangzebs reign in 1673 as well as the iconic alamgiri gate of the lahore fort in 1674 civil wars regarding succession to the mughal throne following aurangzebs death in 1707 led to weakening control over lahore from delhi and a prolonged period of decline in lahore mughal preoccupation with the marathas in the deccan plateau eventually resulted in lahore being governed by a series of governors who pledged nominal allegiance to the everweaker mughal emperors in delhi mughal emperor bahadur shah i died en route to lahore as part of a campaign in 1711 to subdue sikh rebels under the leadership of banda singh bahadur his sons fought a battle outside lahore in 1712 for succession to the mughal crown with jahandar winning the throne sikh rebels were defeated during the reign of farrukhsiyar when abd assamad and zakariyya khan suppressed them nader shahs brief invasion of the mughal empire in early 1739 wrested control away from zakariya khan bahadur though khan was able to win back control after the persian armies had left nader shahs invasion shifted trade routes away from lahore and south towards kandahar instead indus ports near the arabian sea that served lahore also silted up during this time reducing the citys importance even further struggles between zakariyya khans sons following his death in 1745 further weakened muslim control over lahore thus leaving the city in a power vacuum and vulnerable to foreign marauders ahmad shah durrani the founder of the durrani empire occupied lahore in 1748 following ahmed shah durranis quick retreat the mughals entrusted lahore to mu’īn almulk mir mannu ahmad shah durrani again invaded in 1751 forcing mir mannu into signing a treaty that submitted lahore to afghan rule later in 1752 lahore was second time conquered by ahmad shah abdali in the battle of lahore 1752 the mughal wazīr ghazi din imad almulk would seize lahore in 1756 provoking ahmad shah durrani to again invade in 1757 after which he placed the city under the rule of his son timur shah durrani durrani rule was interrupted when lahore was conquered by the marathas in 1758 during their campaigns against the afghans under raghunathrao who drove out the afghans the following year a combined sikh–maratha force defeated an afghan assault in 1759 following the third battle of panipat ahmad shah durrani defeated the marathas and recaptured lahore after the durranis withdrew from the city in 1765 sikh forces quickly occupied the city the durranis invaded two more times—in 1797 and 1798—under shah zaman but the sikhs reoccupied the city after both invasions samadhi of ranjit singh gurdwara dera sahib haveli of nau nihal singh hazuri bagh gurdwara janam asthan guru ram das the lava temple at the lahore fort dates from the sikh period and is dedicated to the hindu deity lava expanding sikh misls secured control over lahore in 1767 when the bhangi misl state captured the city in 1780 the city was divided among three rulers gujjar singh lahna singh and sobha singh instability resulting from this arrangement allowed nearby amritsar to establish itself as the areas primary commercial centre in place of lahore ahmad shah durranis grandson zaman shah invaded lahore in 1796 and again in 1798–99 ranjit singh negotiated with the afghans for the post of subahdar to control lahore following the second invasion by the end of the 18th century the citys population drastically declined with its remaining residents living within the city walls while the extramural suburbs lay abandoned forcing travellers to pass through abandoned and ruined suburbs for a few miles before reaching the citys gates in the aftermath of zaman shah’s 1799 invasion of punjab ranjit singh of nearby gujranwala began to consolidate his position singh was able to seize control of the region after a series of battles with the sikh bhangi misl chiefs who had seized lahore in 1780 his army marched to anarkali where according to legend the gatekeeper of the lohari gate mukham din chaudhry opened the gates allowing ranjit singhs army to enter lahore after capturing lahore sikh soldiers immediately began plundering muslim areas of the city until their actions were reined in by ranjit singh ranjit singhs rule restored some of lahores lost grandeur but at the expense of destroying the remaining mughal architecture for building materials he established a mint in the city in 1800 and moved into the mughal palace at the lahore fort after repurposing it for his own use in governing the sikh empire in 1801 he established the gurdwara janam asthan guru ram das to mark the site where guru ram das was born in 1534 lahore became the empires administrative capital though the nearby economic centre of amritsar had also been established as the empires spiritual capital by 1802 by 1812 singh had mostly refurbished the citys defences by adding a second circuit of outer walls surrounding akbars original walls with the two separated by a moat singh also partially restored shah jahans decaying shalimar gardens and built the hazuri bagh baradari in 1818 to celebrate his capture of the kohinoor diamond from shuja shah durrani in 1813 he erected the gurdwara dera sahib to mark the site of guru arjan devs death 1606 the sikh royal court also endowed religious architecture in the city including a number of sikh gurdwaras hindu temples and havelis while much of lahores mughal era fabric lay in ruins by the time of his arrival ranjit singhs rule saw the reestablishment of lahores glory – though mughal monuments suffered during the sikh period singhs armies plundered most of lahores most precious mughal monuments and stripped the white marble from several monuments to send to different parts of the sikh empire during his reign monuments plundered for decorative materials include the tomb of asif khan the tomb of nur jahan and the shalimar gardens ranjit singhs army also desecrated the badshahi mosque by converting it into an ammunition depot and a stable for horses the sunehri mosque in the walled city of lahore was also converted to a gurdwara while the mosque of mariyam zamani begum was repurposed into a gunpowder factory the sikh royal court lahore durbar underwent a quick succession of rulers after the death of ranjit singh his son kharak singh died on 6 november 1840 soon after taking the throne on that same day the next appointed successor to the throne nau nihal singh died in an accident at the gardens of hazuri bagh maharaja sher singh was then selected as maharajah though his claim to the throne was quickly challenged by chand kaur widow of kharak singh and mother of nau nihal singh who quickly seized the throne sher singh raised an army that attacked chand kaurs forces in lahore on 14 january 1841 his soldiers mounted weaponry on the minarets of the badshahi mosque in order to target chand kaurs forces in the lahore fort destroying the forts historic diwaneaam kaur quickly ceded the throne but sher sing was then assassinated in 1843 in lahores chah miran neighbourhood along with his wazir dhiyan singh dhyan singhs son hira singh sought to avenge his fathers death by laying siege to lahore in order to capture his fathers assassins the siege resulted in the capture of his fathers murderer ajit singh duleep singh was then crowned maharajah with hira singh as his wazir but his power would be weakened by the continued infighting among sikh nobles as well as confrontations against the british during the two anglosikh wars after the conclusion of the two anglosikh wars the sikh empire fell into disarray resulting in the fall of the lahore durbar and commencement of british rule after they captured lahore and the wider punjab region university of the punjab government college university lahore museum lahore high court king edward medical university the british east india company seized control of lahore in february 1846 from the collapsing sikh state and occupied the rest of punjab in 1848 following the defeat of the sikhs at the battle of gujrat british troops formally deposed maharaja duleep singh in lahore that same year punjab was then annexed to the british indian empire in 1849 at the commencement of british rule lahore was estimated to have a population of 120000 prior to annexation by the british lahores environs consisted mostly of the walled city surrounded by plains interrupted by settlements to the south and east such as mozang and qila gujar singh which have since been engulfed by modern lahore the plains between the settlements also contained the remains of mughal gardens tombs and sikhera military structures the british viewed lahores walled city as a bed of potential social discontent and disease epidemics and so largely left the inner city alone while focusing development efforts in lahores suburban areas and punjabs fertile countryside the british instead laid out their capital city in an area south of the walled city that would first come to be known as donalds town before being renamed civil station under early british rule formerly prominent mughalera monuments that were scattered throughout civil station were also repurposed and sometimes desecrated – including the tomb of anarkali which the british had initially converted to clerical offices before repurposing it as an anglican church in 1851 the 17thcentury dai anga mosque was converted into railway administration offices during this time the tomb of nawab bahadur khan was converted into a storehouse and the tomb of mir mannu was used as a wine shop the british also used older structures to house municipal offices such as the civil secretariat public works department and accountant generals office the british built the lahore railway station just outside the walled city shortly after the sepoy mutiny of 1857 the station was therefore styled as a medieval castle to ward off any potential future uprisings with thick walls turrets and holes to direct gun and cannon fire for the defence of the structure lahores most prominent government institutions and commercial enterprises came to be concentrated in civil station in a halfmile wide area flanking the mall where unlike in lahores military zone the british and locals were allowed to mix the mall continues to serve as the epicentre of lahores civil administration as well as one of its most fashionable commercial areas the british also laid the spacious lahore cantonment to the southeast of the walled city at the former village of mian mir where unlike around the mall laws did exist against the mixing of different races lahore was visited on 9 february 1870 by prince alfred duke of edinburgh – a visit in which he received delegations from the dogras of jammu maharajas of patiala the nawab of bahawalpur and other rulers from various punjabi states during the visit he visited several of lahores major sights british authorities built several important structures around the time of the golden jubilee of queen victoria 1887 in the distinctive indosaracenic style including the lahore museum and mayo school of industrial arts the british carried out a census of lahore in 1901 and counted 20691 houses in the walled city an estimated 200000 people lived in lahore at this time lahores posh model town was established as a garden town suburb in 1921 while krishan nagar locality was laid in the 1930s near the mall and walled city lahore played an important role in the independence movements of both india and pakistan the declaration of the independence of india was moved by jawaharlal nehru and passed unanimously at midnight on 31 december 1929 at lahores bradlaugh hall the indian swaraj flag was adopted this time as well lahores jail was used by the british to imprison independence activists such as jatin das and was also where bhagat singh was hanged in 1931 under the leadership of muhammad ali jinnah the all india muslim league passed the lahore resolution in 1940 demanding the creation of pakistan as a separate homeland for the muslims of india the 1941 census showed that city of lahore had a population of 671659 of which was 645 muslim with the remainder 35 being hindu and sikh alongside a small christian community the population figure was disputed by hindus and sikhs before the boundary commission that would draw the radcliffe line to demarcate the border of the two new states based on religious demography in a bid to have lahore awarded to india they argued that the city was only 54 muslim and that hindu and sikh domination of the citys economy and educational institutions should trump muslim demography twothirds of shops and 80 of lahores factories belonged to the hindu and sikh community kuldip nayyar claimed that cyril radcliffe had told him in 1971 that he originally had planned to give lahore to the new dominion of india but decided to place it within the dominion of pakistan which he saw as lacking a major city as he had already awarded calcutta to india as tensions grew over the citys uncertain fate lahore experienced partitions worst riots carnage ensued in which all three religious groups were both victims and perpetrators early riots in march and april 1947 destroyed 6000 of lahores 82000 homes violence continued to rise throughout the summer despite the presence of armoured british personnel hindus and sikhs began to leave the city en masse as their hopes that the boundary commission to award the city to india came to be regarded as increasingly unlikely by late august 1947 66 of hindus and sikhs had left the city the shah alami bazaar once a largely hindu quarter of the walled city was entirely burnt down during subsequent rioting when pakistans independence was declared on 14 august 1947 the radcliffe line had not yet been announced and so cries of long live pakistan and god is greatest were heard intermittently with long live hindustan throughout the night on 17 august 1947 lahore was awarded to pakistan on the basis of its muslim majority in the 1941 census and was made capital of the punjab province in the new state of pakistan the citys location near the indian border meant that it received large numbers of refugees fleeing eastern punjab and northern india though it was able to accommodate them given the large stock of abandoned hindu and sikh properties that could be redistributed to newly arrived refugees islamic summit minar minarepakistan grand jamia mosque provincial assembly of the punjab wapda house arfa karim tower in lahore partition left lahore with a muchweakened economy and a stymied social and cultural scene that had previously been invigorated by the citys hindus and sikhs industrial production dropped to onethird of prepartition levels by the end of the 1940s and only 27 of its manufacturing units were operating by 1950 and usually wellbelow capacity capital flight further weakened the citys economy while karachi industrialized and became more prosperous the citys weakened economy and proximity to the indian border meant that the city was deemed unsuitable to be the pakistani capital after independence karachi was therefore chosen to be capital on account of its relative tranquillity during the partition period stronger economy and better infrastructure after independence lahore slowly regained its significance as an economic and cultural centre of western punjab reconstruction began in 1949 of the shah alami bazaar the former commercial heart of the walled city until it was destroyed in the 1947 riots the tomb of allama iqbal was built in 1951 to honour the philosopherpoet who provided the spiritual inspiration for the pakistan movement in 1955 lahore was selected to be the capital of all west pakistan during the singleunit period that lasted until 1970 shortly afterwards lahores iconic minarepakistan was completed in 1968 to mark the spot where the pakistan resolution was passed with support from the united nations the government was able to rebuild lahore and most scars from the communal violence of partition were ameliorated the second islamic summit conference was held in the city in 1974 in retaliation for the destruction of the babri masjid in india riots erupted in 1992 in which several nonmuslim monuments were targeted including the tomb of maharaja sher singh and the former jain temple near the mall in 1996 the international cricket council cricket world cup final match was held at the gaddafi stadium in lahore the walled city of lahore restoration project began in 2009 when the punjab government restored the royal trail from akbari gate to the lahore fort with money from the world bank lahore is in northeastern portion of pakistan lying between

lahore in the northern part of the city which contains several world heritage sites and national heritage sites lahores urban planning was not based on geometric design but was instead built piecemeal with small culdesacs as katrahs and galis developed in the context of neighbouring buildings though certain neighbourhoods were named for particular religious or ethnic communities the neighbourhoods themselves typically were diverse and were not dominated by the namesake group lahores urban typology is similar to other ancient cities in south asia such as peshawar multan and delhi – all of which were founded near a major river and included an old walled city and royal citadel by the end of the sikh rule most of lahores massive haveli compounds had been occupied by settlers new neighbourhoods occasionally grew up entirely within the confines of an old mughal haveli such as the mohallah pathan wali which grew within the ruins of a haveli of the same name built by mian khan by 1831 all mughal havelis in the walled city had been encroached upon by the surrounding neighbourhood leading to the modernday absence of any mughal havelis in lahore a total of thirteen gates once surrounded the historic walled city some of the remaining gates include the raushnai gate masti gate yakki gate kashmiri gate khizri gate shah burj gate akbari gate and lahori gate southeast of the walled city is the spacious britishera lahore cantonment lahore is home to numerous monuments from the mughal dynasty sikh empire and the british indian raj the architectural style of the walled city of lahore has traditionally been influenced by mughal and sikh styles by the arrival of the sikh empire at the end of the 18th century lahore had decayed from its former glory as the mughal capital rebuilding efforts under ranjit singh and his successors were influenced by mughal practices and lahore was known as the city of gardens during the ranjit singh period later british maps of the area surrounding lahore dating from the mid19th century show many walled private gardens which were confiscated from the muslim noble families bearing the names of prominent sikh nobles – a pattern of patronage which was inherited from the mughals while much of lahores mughalera fabric lay in ruins by the time of his arrival ranjit singhs armys plundered most of lahores most precious mughal monuments and stripped the white marble from several monuments to send to different parts of the sikh empire monuments plundered of their marble include the tomb of asif khan and the tomb of nur jahan the shalimar gardens was plundered of much of its marble and its costly agate gate was stripped the sikh state also demolished a number of shrines and monuments laying outside the citys walls still sikh rule left lahore with several monuments and a heavily altered lahore fort ranjit singhs rule restored some of lahores previous grandeur and the city was left with a large number of religious monuments from this period several havelis were built during this era though only a few still remain as the capital of british punjab the city derived much of its architecture from british colonialists structures were built predominantly in the indogothic style – a syncretic architectural style that blends elements of victorian and islamic architecture o r in the distinct indosaracenic style the british also built neoclassical montgomery hall which today serves as the quaideazam library lawrence gardens were also laid near civil station and were paid for by donations solicited from both lahores european community as well as from wealthy locals the gardens featured over 600 species of plants and were tended to by a horticulturist sent from londons royal botanic gardens at kew the leafy suburbs to the south of the old city as well as the cantonment southwest of the old city were largely developed under british colonial rule and feature colonialera buildings built alongside leafy avenues the british authorities built several important structures around the time of the golden jubilee of queen victoria in 1887 in the distinctive indosaracenic style such as the lahore museum and mayo school of industrial arts other prominent examples of the indosaracenic style in lahore include lahores prestigious aitchison college the punjab chief court today the lahore high court lahore museum and the university of the punjab many of lahores most important buildings were designed by civil engineer and architect sir ganga ram who is considered the father of modern lahore lahore is also known as the city of gardens due to its large number of gardens the shahdara bagh was one of the earliest mughal gardens laid out in 15th century and contains the tomb of jahangir the shalimar gardens were laid out during the reign of shah jahan and were designed to mimic the islamic paradise of the afterlife described in the quran the gardens follow the familiar charbagh layout of four squares with three descending terraces in 1818 hazuri bagh was built during reign of ranjit singh to celebrate his capture of the kohinoor diamond from shuja shah durrani the lawrence garden was established in 1862 and was originally named after sir john lawrence late 19thcentury british viceroy to india the circular garden which surrounds the walled city on three sides was established by 1892 the former parade

mohallah in the old city located in innerpeshawar many historic monuments and bazaars exist in the 21st century including the mohabbat khan mosque kotla mohsin khan chowk yadgar and the qissa khawani

named after a gujjar choudhry gujjar owner of the towns persian wheel that supplied water to the town evidence suggests however that the city derives its name from serai gujran meaning inn of gujjars a village once located near what is now gujranwalas khiyali gate gujranwala was founded by gurjars in the eighteenth century however the exact origins of gujranwala are unclear unlike the ancient nearby cities of sialkot and lahore gujranwala is a relatively modern city it may have been established as a village in the middle of the 16th century locals traditionally believe that gujranwalas original name was khanpur sansi though recent scholarship suggests that the village was possibly serai gujran instead  a village once located near what is now gujranwalas khiyali gate that was mentioned by several sources during the 18thcentury invasion of ahmad shah abdali in 1707 with the death of the mughal emperor aurangzeb mughal power began to rapidly weaken especially following nader shahs invasion in 1739 and then completely dissipated from the punjab region due to the invasions of ahmad shah abdali who raided punjab many times between 1747 and 1772 causing much devastation and chaos abdalis control over the region began to weaken in the latter part of the 18th century with the rise of the sikh misls independent chieftainships usually consisting of the chiefs kinsmen who overran punjab charat singh ruler of the sukerchakia misl established himself in a fort which he had built in the area of gujranwala between 1756 and 1758 nuruddin a jammubased afghan pashtun general was ordered by abdali to subdue the sikhs but was driven back at sialkot by sikh soldiers led by charat singh in 1761 khwaja abed khan abdalis governor in lahore tried to besiege charat singhs base in

succeeded by his son maha singh who added to the lands that charat singh had not only captured but also capably administered in the gujranwala area in the 1770s the jat chathas of wazirabad and rajput bhattis of hafizabad muslims in both cases offered ‘fierce resistance’ to the sukerchakias whose attack was aided by sahib singh of the bhangi misl describing the conflict the british writer of the gujranwala gazetteer wrote that besieged for weeks in his fortress ghulam muhammad chatha eventually surrendered after maha singh assured him safe passage to mecca but the promise was ‘basely broken’ when ghulam muhammad was shot and his fortress razed to the ground rasoolnagar prophets city which belonged to the chathas was renamed ramnagar rams city to humiliate the muslims the gazetteer noted that the treacherous killing of chatha and his resistance was remembered ‘in many a local ballad’ in gujranwala the bhattis of hafizabad tehsil who were muslim rajputs did not cease their resistance to the sukerchakias until 1801 when their leaders were killed and their possessions captured some bhattis fled to jhang ranjit singh maha singhs son and successor who would later go on to establish

ranjit singhs capital until he captured lahore from the durrani afghans in 1799 at which point the capital was moved there leading to the relative decline of gujranwala in favour of lahorejind kaur

significantly above the average of poor isolated regions of pakistan claims of health and long life were almost always based solely on the statements by the local mir king an author who had significant and sustained contact with burusho people john clark reported that they were overall unhealthy however whether or not their putative longevity is true it is undoubtable that the hunza people lead a healthy lifestyle many researchers have lived with the hunza people to answer this mystery including robert mccarrison who did not discover a single person with diseases such as cancer

the rawalpindi division of west punjab the maharajas administration is said to have started levying punitive taxes on the peasantry which provoked a local revolt and the administration resorted to brutal suppression the areas population swelled by recently demobilised soldiers following world war ii rebelled against the maharajas forces and gained control of almost the entire district following this victory the propakistan chieftains of the western districts of muzaffarabad poonch and mirpur proclaimed a provisional azad jammu and kashmir government in rawalpindi on october 3 1947note 2 ghulam nabi gilkar under the assumed name mr anwar issued a proclamation in the name of the provisional government in muzaffarabad however this government quickly fizzled out with the arrest of anwar

airlifted into srinagar pakistan intervened subsequently fighting ensued between the indian and pakistani armies with the two areas of control more or less stabilised around what is now known as the line of control india later approached the united nations asking it to resolve the dispute and resolutions were passed in favour of the holding of a plebiscite with regard to kashmirs future however no such plebiscite has ever been held on either side since there was a precondition that required the withdrawal of the pakistani army along with the nonstate elements and the subsequent partial withdrawal of the indian army  from the parts of kashmir under their respective control\\xa0– a withdrawal that never took place in 1949 a formal ceasefire line separating the indian and pakistanicontrolled parts of kashmir came into effect following the 1949 ceasefire agreement with india the government of pakistan divided the northern and western parts of kashmir that it controlled at the time of the ceasefire into the following two separately controlled political entities in 1955 the poonch uprising broke out it was largely concentrated in areas of rawalakot as well as the rest of poonch division it ended in 1956 at one time under pakistani control kashmirs shaksgam tract a small region along the northeastern border of gilgit–baltistan was provisionally ceded by pakistan to the peoples republic of china in 1963 and now forms part of chinas xinjiang uygur autonomous region in 1972 the then current border between the indian and pakistani controlled parts of kashmir was designated as the line of control this line has remained unchanged since the 1972 simla agreement which bound the two countries to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations some political experts claim that in view of that pact the only solution to the issue is mutual negotiation between the two countries without involving a third party such as the united nation the 1974 interim constitution act was passed by the 48member azad jammu and kashmir unicameral assembly in april 1997 the nawaz sharif government refused to grant constitutional status to azad jammu and kashmir stating that the grant of constitutional rights to these people will amount to unilateral annexation of these areas azad jammu and kashmir ajk is nominally a selfgoverning state but ever since the 1949 ceasefire between indian and pakistani forces pakistan has exercised control over the state without incorporating it into pakistan azad kashmir has its own elected president prime minister legislative assembly high court with azam khan as its present chief justice and official flag azad kashmirs budget and tax affairs are dealt with by the azad jammu and kashmir council rather than by pakistans central board of revenue the azad jammu and kashmir council is a supreme body consisting of 14 members 8 from the government of azad jammu and kashmir and 6 from the government of

has celebrated kashmir solidarity day on february 5 of each year since 1990 as a day of protest against indias de facto sovereignty over its state of jammu and kashmir that day is a national holiday in pakistan pakistan observes the kashmir accession day as black day on october 27 of each year since 1947 as a day of protest against the accession of jammu and kashmir state to india and its military presence in the indiancontrolled parts of jammu and kashmir brad adams the asia director at the usbased ngo human rights watch said in 2006 although azad means free the residents of azad kashmir are anything but the pakistani authorities govern the azad kashmir government with tight controls on basic freedoms scholar christopher snedden has observed that despite tight controls the people of azad kashmir have generally accepted whatever pakistan has done to them which in any case has varied little from how most pakistanis have been treated by pakistan according to christopher snedden one of the reasons for this was that the people of azad kashmir had always wanted to be part of pakistan consequently having little to fear from a propakistan population devoid of options pakistan imposed its will through the federal ministry of kashmir affairs and failed to empower the people of azad kashmir allowing genuine selfgovernment for only a short period in the 1970s according to the interim constitution that was drawn up in the 1970s the only political parties that are allowed to exist are those that pay allegiance to pakistan no person or political party in azad jammu and kashmir shall be permitted activities prejudicial or detrimental to the states accession to pakistan the proindependence jammu and kashmir liberation front has never been allowed to contest elections in azad kashmir while the interim constitution does not give them a choice the people of azad kashmir have not considered any option other than joining pakistan except in a legal sense azad kashmir has been fully integrated into pakistan azad kashmir is home to a vibrant civil society one of the organizations active in the territory and inside pakistan is yfkinternational kashmir lobby group an ngo that seeks better indiapakistan relations through conflict resolution in kashmir according to the project report by the asian development bank the bank has set out development goals for azad kashmir in the areas of health education nutrition and social development the whole project is estimated to cost us76 million germany between 2006 and 2014 has also donated 38 million towards the ajk health infrastructure programme the state is administratively divided into three divisions which in turn are divided into ten districts the population of azad kashmir according to the preliminary results of the 2017 census is 4045 million the website of the ajk government reports the literacy rate to be 74 with the enrolment rate in primary school being 98 and 90 for boys and girls respectively the population of azad kashmir is almost entirely muslim the people of this region culturally differ from the kashmiris living in the kashmir valley of jammu and kashmir and are closer to the culture of jammu mirpur kotli and bhimber are all old towns of the jammu region azad jammu and kashmir has an almost entirely muslim population according to data maintained by christian community organizations there are around 4500 christian residents in the region bhimber is home to most of them followed by mirpur and muzaffarabad a few dozen families also live in kotli poonch and bagh however the christian community has been struggling to get residential status and property rights in ajk there is no official data on the total number of bahais in ajk only six bahai families are known to be living in muzaffarabad with others living in rural areas the followers of the ahmadi faith are estimated to be somewhere between 20000 and 25000 and most of them live in kotli mirpur bhimber and muzaffarabad christopher snedden writes that most of the native residents of azad kashmir are not of kashmiri ethnicity rather they could be called jammuites due to their historical and cultural links with that region which is coterminous with neighbouring punjab and hazara because their region was formerly a part of the princely state of jammu and kashmir and is named after it many azad kashmiris have adopted the kashmiri identity whereas in an ethnolinguistic context the term kashmiri would ordinarily refer to natives of the kashmir valley region the population of azad kashmir has strong historical cultural and linguistic affinities with the neighbouring populations of upper punjab and potohar region of pakistan whereas the sudhans have the oral tradition of the pashtuns the main communities living in this region are languages by approximate number of speakers the official language of azad kashmir is urdunote 3 while english is used in higher domains the majority of the population however are native speakers of other languages the foremost among these is pahari–pothwari with its various dialects there are also sizeable communities speaking kashmiri mostly in the north gujari throughout the territory and dogri in the south as well as pockets of speakers of kundal shahi shina and pashto with the exception of pashto and english those languages belong to the indoaryan language family the dialects of the paharipothwari language complex cover most of the territory of azad kashmir those are also spoken across the line of control in the neighbouring areas of indian jammu and kashmir and are closely related both to punjabi to the south and hinko to the northwest the language variety in the southern districts of azad kashmir is known by a variety of names – including mirpuri pothwari and pahari – and is closely related to the pothwari proper spoken to the east in the pothohar region of punjab the dialects of the central districts of azad kashmir are occasionally referred to in the literature as chibhali or punchi but the speakers themselves usually call them pahari an ambiguous name that is also used for several unrelated languages of the lower himalayas going north the speech forms gradually change into hindko today in the muzaffarabad district the preferred local name for the language is hindko although it is still apparently more closely related to the core dialects of pahari further north in the neelam valley the dialect locally also known as parmi can more unambiguously be subsumed under hindko another major language of azad kashmir is gujari it is spoken by several hundred thousandnote 4 people among the traditionally nomadic gujars many of whom are nowadays settled not all ethnic gujars speak gujari the proportion of those who have shifted to other languages is probably higher in southern azad kashmir gujari is most closely related to the rajasthani languages particularly mewati although it also shares features with punjabi it is dispersed over large areas in northern pakistan and india within pakistan the gujari dialects of azad kashmir are more similar in terms of shared basic vocabulary and mutual intelligibility to the gujar varieties of the neighbouring hazara region than to the dialects spoken further to the northwest in khyber pakhtunkhwa and north in gilgit there are scattered communities of kashmiri speakers notably in the neelam valley where they form the secondlargest language group after speakers of hindko there have been calls for the teaching of kashmiri particularly in order to counter indias claim of promoting the culture of kashmir but the limited attempts at introducing the language at the secondary school level have not been successful and it is urdu rather than kashmiri that kashmiri muslims have seen as their identity symbol there is an ongoing process of gradual shift to larger local languages but at least in the neelam valley there still exist communities for whom kashmiri is the sole mother tongue there are speakers of dogri in the southernmost district of bhimber where they are estimated to represent almost a third of the districts population in the northernmost district of neelam there are small communities of speakers of several other languages shina which like kashmiri belongs to the broad dardic group is present in two distinct varieties spoken altogether in three villages pashto of the iranian subgroup and the majority language in the neighbouring province of khyber pakhtunkhwa is spoken in two villages both situated on the line of control the endangered kundal shahi is native to the eponymous village and it is the only language not found outside azad kashmir as of 2021 gdp of azad jammu and kashmir was estimated to be 10 billion pounds giving per capita an income of £5604 historically the economy of azad kashmir has been agricultural which meant that land was the main source or mean of production this means that all food for immediate and longterm consumption was produced from the land the produce included various crops fruits vegetables etc the land was also the source of other livelihood necessities such as wood fuel grazing for animals which then turned into dairy products because of this land was also the main source of revenue for the governments whose primary purpose for centuries was to accumulate revenue agriculture is a major part of azad kashmirs economy lowlying areas that have high populations grow crops like barley mangoes millet corn maize and wheat and also raise cattle in the elevated areas that are less populated and more spread out forestry corn and livestock are the main sources of income there are mineral and marble resources in azad kashmir close to mirpur and muzaffarabad

gubba and silverware agricultural goods produced in the region include mushrooms honey walnuts apples cherries medicinal herbs and plants resin deodar kail chir fir maple and ash timber the migration to the uk was accelerated and by the completion of mangla dam in 1967 the process of chain migration became in full flow today remittances from british mirpuri community make a critical role in ajks economy in the mid1950s various economic and social development processes were launched in azad kashmir in the 1960s with the construction of the mangla dam in mirpur district the azad jammu and kashmir government began to receive royalties from the pakistani government for the electricity that the dam provided to pakistan during the mid2000s a multibilliondollar reconstruction began in the aftermath of the 2005 kashmir earthquake in addition to agriculture textiles and arts and crafts remittances have played a major role in the economy of azad kashmir one analyst estimated that the figure for azad kashmir was 251 in 2001 with regard to annual household income people living in the higher areas are more dependent on remittances than are those living in the lower areas in the latter part of 2006 billions of dollars for development were mooted by international aid agencies for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of earthquakehit zones in azad kashmir though much of that amount was subsequently lost in bureaucratic channels leading to considerable delays in help getting to the neediest hundreds of people continued to live in tents long after the earthquake a landuse

and oman in 1797 and it was not until 1958 that the town and adjoining hinterland were exchanged from oman to pakistan gwadar came in the focus of attention after the kargil war when pakistan felt the need of having a military naval port and the karachigwadar road coastal highway was built for defence purposes for most of its history gwadar was a small to mediumsized settlement with an economy largely based on artisanal fishing the strategic value of its location was first recognized in 1954 when it was identified as a suitable site for a deep water port by the united states geological survey at the request of pakistan while the territory was still under omani rule until 2001 the areas potential to be a major deep water port remained untapped under successive pakistani governments when construction on the first phase of gwadar port was initiated in 2007 the first phase costed 248\\xa0million the port initially remained underutilized after construction for a variety of reasons including lack of investment security concerns and the government of pakistans failure to transfer land as promised to the port operator port of singapore authority in april 2015 pakistan and china announced their intention to develop the 46\\xa0billion china–pakistan economic corridor cpec which in turn forms part of chinas ambitious one belt one road gwadar features heavily in cpec and is also

authority published a request for tenders for the preparation of expropriation and resettlement of old town gwadar the word gwadar is a combination of two balochi words – guad meaning wind and dar meaning gateway or door balochi گوات ءُ در\\u200e thus gwadar means the gate of wind the inhabitation of gwadar like most of the other areas of balochistan appears to be ancient the area shows inhabitation as early as the bronze age with settlements around some of the areas oasis it is from this settlement pattern that the word makran the original name of balochistan is derived for a period it was a region of the achaemenid persian empire it is believed to have been conquered by the founder of the persian empire cyrus the great the capital of the satrapy of gedrosia was pura which is thought to have been located near the modern bampūr in iranian balochistan during the homeward march of alexander the great his admiral nearchus led a fleet along the modernday makran coast and recorded that the area was dry mountainous and inhabited by the ichthyophagoi or fisheaters an ancient greek rendering of the ancient persian phrase mahi khorana which has itself become the modern word makran after the collapse of alexanders empire the area was ruled by seleucus nicator one of alexanders generals the region then came under mauryan rule around 303 bce after seleucus made peace with emperor chandragupta and ceded the territory to the mauryans the region remained on the sidelines of history for a millennium until the arabmuslim army captured makran in ce 643 and over the intervening and nearly equivalent amount of time the area was contested by various powers this was then followed by almost two centuries of local rule by the various baloch tribes the city was visited by ottoman admiral seydi ali reis in the 1550s and mentioned in his book mirat ul memalik the mirror of countries 1557 according to seydi ali reis the inhabitants of gwadar were baloch and their chief was malik jelaleddin son of malik dinar in the 15th century the portuguese conquered parts of india and oman they planned to proceed with annexation of the coastal area of makran they attacked gwadar under the leadership of vasco de gama but under the supervision of commander mir ismaheel baloch the portuguese were defeated by the baloch a few times the portuguese looted and set the coastal villages on fire but they failed to capture gwadar cannons of the portuguese army were found lying near the central jail of gwadar the grave of mir ismaheel baloch is situated near the mountain of batal gwadar constructed by mir ismaheel baloch himself during life he died in 873 hijri heirless\\nby the end of the 16th century mughal emperor akbar the great conquered the city along with all of balochistan after the battle of sehwan it remained under mughal control until early 18th century towards the end of the 18th century the khan of kalat mir noori naseer khan baloch granted suzerainty over gwadar to sultan bin ahmad the ruler of muscat when the sultan subsequently retook muscat he was to continue his rule in gwadar by appointing a wali or governor this wali was then ordered to subjugate the nearby coastal town of chabahar now in iran the gwadar fort was built during omani rule in the middle of the 18th century mir noori naseer khan baloch captured gwadar and its surrounding areas after defeating the gichki baloch tribe and included it in the kalat khanate however realizing that maintaining control of the area will be difficult without the support of the gichkis mir nasir entered into an agreement with the local gichki chief which allowed the gichkis to maintain administrative control of the area in return for furnishing half the collected revenues to kalat this arrangement continued till 1783 when saiad sultan fell out with his brother the ruler of muscat and asked for help mir noori naseer khan handed over gwadar as part of his share of revenues to saiad sultan for his maintenance with the understanding that the area be returned to kalat when saiad sultan acquires the throne saiad sultan ascended to the throne of muscat in 1797 but never returned gwadar enclave to kalat the ensuing struggle between the heirs of the sultan and khan of kalat for possession of gwadar allowed the british to intervene telegraph lines were later extended into the town courtesy of the britishcitation needed the main two wali of gwadar were saif bin ali first and eshan azim last from 17831958 the british after extracting concessions from the sultan for the use of the area facilitated muscat to retain gwadar later on the british claimed that the area was granted to the sultan by mir nasir however local accounts and the declassified documents of that time challenge this claim from 1863 to 1879 gwadar was the headquarters of a british assistant political agent gwadar was a fortnightly port of call for the british india steamship navigation companys steamers and included a combined post  telegraph office in 1952 makran acceded to the newly created dominion of pakistan and was made a district – but gwadar at that time was not included in makran in

would be 91 while pakistan will get 9 share china has a great strategic interest in gwadar in 2013 the stateowned china overseas port holdings limited acquired gwadar port the port is strategically important for china as sixty percent of chinas oil comes from the persian gulf by ships traveling over 16000\\xa0km 9900\\xa0mi in two to three months confronting pirates bad weather political rivals and other risks up to its only commercial port shanghai gwadar will reduce the distance to a mere 5000\\xa0km 3100\\xa0mi and also operate yearround china is heavily dependent on persian gulf oil which passes through the strait of malacca all the way through the indian and pacific oceans once the oil reaches chinas east coast ports it is transported thousands of kilometres inland to western china the gwadar port–karakoram highway kkh route is sometimes said to be safer cheaper and shorter than transporting the oil by ocean tanker however research suggests that transporting oil by roadways from gwadar to china would be very expensive would encounter numerous logistical difficulties such as mountainous terrain earthquakes disputes with india and potential terrorist attacks and would barely make any impact on chinas overall energy security though pakistan intends to build an oil pipeline to northern pakistan that may allay much of these concerns chinese goods flowing in the opposite direction may be able to find an easier shorter and secure route to the middle east the city is also being developed as an export processing zone for foreign companies to manufacture in gwadar before exporting to various countries in the region due to the chinese interest in the gwadar port pakistan believes that gwadar will become a regional hub prime minister imran khan laid down

punjabi d͡ʒěˈlˑə̃mᵊ urdu d͡ʒeɦˈləm is a city on the east bank of the jhelum river which is located in the district of jhelum in the north of punjab province pakistan it is the 44th largest city of pakistan by population jhelum is known for providing many soldiers to the british army before independence and later to the pakistan armed forces due to which it is also known as city of soldiers or land of martyrs and warriors jhelum is a few miles upstream from the site of the ancient battle of the hydaspes between the armies of alexander and king porus possibly jhelum city was the capital of porus kingdom paurava a city called bucephala was founded nearby to commemorate the death of alexanders horse bucephalus other notable sites nearby include the 16thcentury rohtas fort the tilla jogian complex of ancient temples and the 16thcentury grand trunk road which passes through the city according to the 2017 census of pakistan the population of jhelum was 190425 the name of the city is derived from the words jal pure water and ham snow as the water that flows through the river originates in the himalayas there are a number of industries in and around jhelum city including a tobacco factory wood marble glass and flour mills its near the capital of pakistan anjum sultan shahbaz recorded some stories of the name jhelum in his book tareekhejhelum as many writers have different opinions about the name of jhelum one suggestion is that in ancient days jhelumabad was known as jalham the word jhelum is reportedly derived from the words jal pure water and ham snow the name thus refers to the waters of a river flowing besides the city which have their origins in the snowcapped himalayas however some writers believe that when daraeazam reached a certain place on the river bank after winning many battles he fixed his flag at that place and called it jaealam which means place of the flag with the passage of time it became jhelum from jaealam according to tradition saeed bin abi waqas brother of saad bin abi waqas was sent to china to preach islam during his journey he arrived at the city of jhelum he saw the reflection of a city in the river and said هذا جهيلم this is jhelum which means city besides the river in full moonlight ahmed shah abdali also used jheelum in place of jhelum and harian for kharian in his diary the rajput gujjars labana who now hold the salt range and its northern plateau respectively appear to have been the earliest inhabitants of jhelum the next major point in the history of the district was the battle of the hydaspes between alexander and the local ruler porus the elder abisares or abhisara in greek αβισαρης called embisarus eμ\\noβισαρoς by diodorus was an indian king of the abhira tribe descent beyond the river hydaspes whose territory lay in the mountains sent embassies to alexander both before and after the conquest of porus in 326 bc although inclined to espouse the side of the latter alexander not only allowed him to retain his kingdom but increased it and on his death appointed his son as his successor porus kingdom paurava was on the left bank of the jhelem river corresponding the limits of the present gujrat district the gakhars appear to represent an early wave of conquerors from the west who still inhabit a large tract in the mountain north of tilla range gakhars were the dominant race during the early muslim era and they long continued to retain their independence both in jhelum itself and in the neighbouring district of rawalpindi in 997 ce sultan mahmud ghaznavi took over the ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father sultan sebuktegin in 1005 he conquered the shahis in kabul and followed it by the conquests of punjab region including jhelum the delhi sultanate and later mughal empire ruled the region the punjab region became predominantly muslim due to missionary sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of punjab region the mughals were persianized turks who claimed descent from both timur and genghis khan and strengthened the persianate culture of muslim india being very few in number main families of mughal barlas the descent of ameeri taimoor settled in mong rasool and afterward scattered to village chak nazar shamaspur aima afghana khardiyala chak sikander malhar muglain mota garbi bhimber they adopted a policy of converting the local jats and gakhars mandatory as recorded in the baburnama thus it is credited to the mughals who were largely responsible for the conversion of the jats to islam with the collapse of the mughal empire after the death of aurangzeb the durrani empire had occupied the plains but were eventually ousted by the sikhs after the decline of the mughal empire the region fell under afghan occupation during the decline of afghan

place was quite unimportant being mainly occupied by a settlement of boatmen and at the time of annexation contained about 500 houses it was then chosen as the site of a cantonment and as the headquarters of the civil administration for some years it was the seat of the commissioner of the division but in 1859 his headquarters were transferred to rawalpindi under british rule jhelum has

govt nowshera with alternative spellings nowshehra and naushera may refer to a tank is an armoured fighting vehicle intended as a primary offensive weapon in frontline ground combat tank designs are a balance of heavy firepower strong armour and good battlefield mobility provided by tracks and a powerful engine usually their main armament is mounted in a turret they are a mainstay of modern 20th and 21st century ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat modern tanks are versatile mobile land weapons platforms whose main armament is a largecaliber tank gun mounted in a rotating gun turret supplemented by machine guns or other ranged weapons such as antitank guided missiles or rocket launchers they have heavy vehicle armour which provides protection for the crew the vehicles munition storage fuel tank and propulsion systems the use of tracks rather than wheels provides improved operational mobility which allows the tank to overcome rugged terrain and adverse conditions such as mud and icesnow better than wheeled vehicles and thus be more flexibly positioned at advantageous locations on the battlefield these features enable the tank to perform well in a variety of intense combat situations simultaneously both offensively with direct fire from their powerful main gun and defensively as fire support and defilade for friendly troops due to the near invulnerability to common infantry small arms and good resistance against heavier weapons although antitank weapons used in 2022 some of them manportable have demonstrated the ability to destroy older generations of tanks with single shotsdisputed  – discuss all while maintaining the mobility needed to exploit changing tactical situations fully integrating tanks into modern military forces spawned a new era of combat armoured warfare until the arrival of the main battle tank tanks were typically categorized either by weight class light medium heavy or superheavy tanks or doctrinal purpose breakthrough cavalry infantry cruiser or reconnaissance tanks some are larger and very heavily armoured and with large guns while others are smaller lightly armoured and equipped with a smaller caliber and lighter gun these smaller tanks move over terrain with speed and agility and can perform a reconnaissance role in addition to engaging enemy targets the smaller faster tank would not normally engage in battle with a larger heavily armoured tank except during a surprise flanking manoeuvre the word tank was first applied to british landships in 1915 to keep their nature secret before they entered service on 24 december 1915 a meeting took place of the interdepartmental conference including representatives of the director of naval constructions committee the admiralty the ministry of munitions and the war office its purpose was to discuss the progress of the plans for what were described as caterpillar machine gun destroyers or land cruisers in his autobiography albert gerald stern secretary to the landship committee later head of the mechanical warfare supply department says that at that meeting mr thomas j macnamara mp and parliamentary and financial secretary to the admiralty then suggested for secrecys sake to change the title of the landship committee mr deyncourt agreed that it was very desirable to retain secrecy by all means and proposed to refer to the vessel as a water carrier in government offices committees and departments are always known by their initials for this reason i as secretary considered the proposed title totally unsuitablea in our search for a synonymous term we changed the word water carrier to tank and became the tank supply or ts committee that is how these weapons came to be called tanks he incorrectly added and the name has now been adopted by all countries in the world lieutenantcolonel ernest swinton who was secretary to the meeting says that he was instructed to find a noncommittal word when writing his report of the proceedings in the evening he discussed it with a fellow officer ltcol walter dally jones and they chose the word tank that night in the draft report of the conference the word tank was employed in its new sense for the first time swintons notes on the employment of tanks in which he uses the word throughout was published in january 1916 in july 1918 popular science monthly reported because a fellow of the royal historical society has unintentionally misled the british public as to the origin of the famous tanks sir william tritton who designed and built them has published the real story of their name\\xa0 since it was obviously inadvisable to herald little willies reason for existence to the world he was known as the instructional demonstration unit little willies hull was called in the shop orders a water carrier for mesopotamia no one knew that the hull was intended to be mounted on a truck naturally the water carrier began to be called a tank so the name came to be used by managers and foremen of the shop until now it has a place in the army vocabulary and will probably be so known in history for all time fj gardiner frhists deyncourts account differs from swintons and trittons \\xa0when the future arrangements were under discussion for transporting the first landships to france a question arose as to how from a security point of view the consignment should be labelled to justify their size we decided to call them watercarriers for russia\\xa0—the idea being that they should be taken for some new method of taking water to forward troops in the battle areas ltcol swinton\\xa0 raised a humorous objection to this remarking that the war office pundits would probably contract the description to wcs for russia and that we had better forestall this by merely labelling the packages tanks so tanks they became and tanks they have remained this appears to be an imperfect recollection he says that the name problem arose when we shipped the first two vehicles to france the following year august 1916 but by that time the name tank had been in use for eight months the tanks were labelled with care to petrograd but the belief was encouraged that they were a type of snowplough the term tank is used throughout the english speaking world but other countries use different terminology in france the second country to use tanks in battle the word tank or tanque was adopted initially but was then largely at the insistence of colonel jbe estienne rejected in favour of char dassaut assault vehicle or simply char vehicle during world war i german sources tended to refer to british tanks as tanks and to their own as kampfwagen later tanks became referred to as panzer lit armour a shortened form of the full term panzerkampfwagen literally armoured fighting vehicle in the arab world tanks are called dabbāba after a type of siege engine in italian a tank is a carro armato lit armed wagon without reference to its armour norway uses the term stridsvogn and sweden the similar stridsvagn lit battle wagon also used for chariots whereas denmark uses kampvogn lit fight wagon finland uses panssarivaunu armoured wagon although tankki is also used colloquially the polish name czołg derived from verb czołgać się to crawl is used depicting the way of machines movement and its speed in hungarian the tank is called harckocsi combat wagon albeit tank is also common in japanese the term sensha 戦車 lit battle vehicle is taken from chinese and used and this term is likewise borrowed into korean as jeoncha 전차戰車 more recent chinese literature uses the englishderived 坦克 tǎnkè tank as opposed to 戰車 zhànchē battle vehicle used in earlier days the modern tank is the result of a century of development from the first primitive armoured vehicles due to improvements in technology such as the internal combustion engine which allowed the rapid movement of heavy armoured vehicles as a result of these advances tanks underwent tremendous shifts in capability in the years since their first appearance tanks in world war i were developed separately and simultaneously by great britain and france as a means to break the deadlock of trench warfare on the western front the first british prototype nicknamed little willie was constructed at william foster  co in lincoln england in 1915 with leading roles played by major walter gordon wilson who designed the gearbox and hull and by william tritton of william foster and co who designed the track plates this was a prototype of a new design that would become the british armys mark i tank the first tank used in combat in september 1916 during the battle of the somme the name tank was adopted by the british during the early stages of their development as a security measure to conceal their purpose see etymology while the british and french built thousands of tanks in world war i germany was unconvinced of the tanks potential and did not have enough resources thus it built only twenty tanks of the interwar period evolved into the much larger and more powerful designs of world war ii important new concepts of armoured warfare were developed the soviet union launched the first mass tankair attack at khalkhin gol nomonhan in august 1939 and later developed the t34 one of the predecessors of the main battle tank less than two weeks later germany began their largescale armoured campaigns that would become known as blitzkrieg lightning war – massed concentrations of tanks combined with motorized and mechanized infantry artillery and air power designed to break through the enemy front and collapse enemy resistance the widespread introduction of highexplosive antitank warheads during the second half of world war ii led to lightweight infantrycarried antitank weapons such as the panzerfaust which could destroy some types of tanks tanks in the cold war were designed with these weapons in mind and led to greatly improved armour types during the 1960s especially composite armour improved engines transmissions and suspensions allowed tanks of this period to grow larger aspects of gun technology changed significantly as well with advances in shell design and aiming technology during the cold war the main battle tank concept arose and became a key component of modern armies in the 21st century with the increasing role of asymmetrical warfare and the end of the cold war that also contributed to the increase of costeffective antitank rocket propelled grenades rpgs worldwide and its successors the ability of tanks to operate independently has declined modern tanks are more frequently organized into combined arms units which involve the support of infantry who may accompany the tanks in infantry fighting vehicles and supported by reconnaissance or groundattack aircraft the tank is the 20thcentury realization of an ancient concept that of providing troops with mobile protection and firepower the internal combustion engine armour plate and continuous track were key innovations leading to the invention of the modern tank many sources imply that leonardo da vinci and h g wells in some way foresaw or invented the tank leonardos late15thcentury drawings of what some describe as a tank show a manpowered wheeled vehicle with cannons all around it however the human crew would not have enough power to move it over larger distance and usage of animals was problematic in a space so confined in the 15th century jan žižka built armoured wagons containing cannons and used them effectively in several battles the continuous caterpillar track arose from attempts to improve the mobility of wheeled vehicles by spreading their weight reducing ground pressure and increasing their traction experiments can be traced back as far as the 17th century and by the late nineteenth they existed in various recognizable and practical forms in several countries it is frequently claimed that richard lovell edgeworth created a caterpillar track it is true that in 1770 he patented a machine that should carry and lay down its own road but this was edgeworths choice of words his own account in his autobiography is of a horsedrawn wooden carriage on eight retractable legs capable of lifting itself over high walls the description bears no similarity to a caterpillar track armoured trains appeared in the mid19th century and various armoured steam and petrolengined vehicles were also proposed the machines described in wellss 1903 short story the land ironclads are a step closer insofar as they are armourplated have an internal power plant and are able to cross trenches some aspects of the story foresee the tactical use and impact of the tanks that later came into being however wellss vehicles were driven by steam and moved on pedrail wheels technologies that were already outdated at the time of writing after seeing british tanks in 1916 wells denied having invented them writing yet let me state at once that i was not their prime originator i took up an idea manipulated it slightly and handed it on it is though possible that one of the british tank pioneers ernest swinton was subconsciously or otherwise influenced by wellss tale the first combinations of the three principal components of the tank appeared in the decade before world war one in 1903 captain léon rené levavasseur of the french artillery proposed mounting a field gun in an armoured box on tracks major william e donohue of the british armys mechanical transport committee suggested fixing a gun and armoured shield on a british type of trackdriven vehicle the first armoured car was produced in austria in 1904 however all were restricted to rails or reasonably passable terrain it was the development of a practical caterpillar track that provided the necessary independent allterrain mobility in a memorandum of 1908 antarctic explorer robert falcon scott presented his view that manhauling to the south pole was impossible and that motor traction was needed snow vehicles did not yet exist however and so his engineer reginald skelton developed the idea of a caterpillar track for snow surfaces these tracked motors were built by the wolseley tool and motor car company in birmingham and tested in switzerland and norway and can be seen in action in herbert pontings 1911 documentary film of scotts antarctic terra nova expedition scott died during the expedition in 1912 but expedition member and biographer apsley cherrygarrard credited scotts motors with the inspiration for the british world war i tanks writing scott never knew their true possibilities for they were the direct ancestors of the tanks in francepage\\xa0needed in 1911 a lieutenant engineer in the austrian army günther burstyn presented to the austrian and prussian war ministries plans for a light threeman tank with a gun in a revolving turret the socalled burstynmotorgeschütz in the same year an australian civil engineer named lancelot de mole submitted a basic design for a tracked armoured vehicle to the british war office in russia vasiliy mendeleev designed a tracked vehicle containing a large naval gun all of these ideas were rejected and by 1914 forgotten although it was officially acknowledged after the war that de moles design was at least the equal to the initial british tanks various individuals continued to contemplate the use of tracked vehicles for military applications but by the outbreak of the war no one in a position of responsibility in any army seems to have given much thought to tankscitation needed the direct military impact of the tank can be debated but its effect on the germans was immense it caused bewilderment terror and concern in equal measure it was also a huge boost to the civilians at home after facing the zeppelins at last britain had a wonder weapon tanks were taken on tours and treated almost like film stars from late 1914 a small number of middleranking british army officers tried to persuade the war office and the government to consider the creation of armoured vehicles amongst their suggestions was the use of caterpillar tractors but although the army used many such vehicles for towing heavy guns it could not be persuaded that they could be adapted as armoured vehicles the consequence was that early tank development in the united kingdom was carried out by the royal navy as the result of an approach by royal naval air service officers who had been operating armoured cars on the western front the first lord of the admiralty winston churchill formed the landship committee on 20 february 1915 the director of naval construction for the royal navy eustace tennyson deyncourt was appointed to head the committee in view of his experience with the engineering methods it was felt might be required the two other members were naval officers and a number of industrialists were engaged as consultants so many played a part in its long and complicated development that it is not possible to name any individual as the sole inventor of the tank however leading roles were played by lt walter gordon wilson rn who designed the gearbox and developed practical tracks and by william tritton whose agricultural machinery company william foster  co in lincoln lincolnshire england built the prototypes on 22 july 1915 a commission was placed to design a machine that could cross a trench 4\\xa0ft wide secrecy surrounded the project with the designers locking themselves in a room at the white hart hotel in lincoln the committees first design little willie ran for the first time in september 1915 and served to develop the form of the track but an improved design better able to cross trenches swiftly followed and in january 1916 the prototype nicknamed mother was adopted as the design for future tanks the first order for tanks was placed on 12 february 1916 and a second on 21 april fosters built 37 all male and metropolitan railway carriage and wagon company of birmingham 113 38 male and 75 female a total of 150 production models of male tanks armed with naval cannon and machine guns and females carrying only machineguns would go on to fight in historys first tank action at the somme in september 1916 great britain produced about 2600 tanks of various types during the war the first tank to engage in battle was designated d1 a british mark i male during the battle of flerscourcelette part of the wider somme offensive on 15 september 1916 bert chaney a nineteenyearold signaller with the 7th london territorial battalion reported that three huge mechanical monsters such as he had never seen before  rumbled their way onto the battlefield frightening the jerries out of their wits and making them scuttle like frightened rabbits when the news of the first use of the tanks emerged prime minister david lloyd george commented it is really to mr winston churchill that the credit is due more than to anyone else he took up with enthusiasm the idea of making them a long time ago and he met with many difficulties he converted me and at the ministry of munitions he went ahead and made them the admiralty experts were invaluable and gave the greatest possible assistance they are of course experts in the matter of armour plating major stern formerly an officer in the royal naval air service a business man at the ministry of munitions had charge of the work of getting them built and he did the task very well col swinton and others also did valuable work whilst several experimental machines were investigated in france it was a colonel of artillery jbe estienne who directly approached the commanderinchief with detailed plans for a tank on caterpillar tracks in late 1915 the result was two largely unsatisfactory types of tank 400 each of the schneider and saintchamond both based on the holt tractor the following year the french pioneered the use of a full 360° rotation turret in a tank for the first time with the creation of the renault ft light tank with the turret containing the tanks main armament in addition to the traversable turret another innovative feature of the ft was its engine located at the rear this pattern with the gun located in a mounted turret and the engine at the back has become the standard for most succeeding tanks across the world even to this day the ft was the most numerous tank of the war over 3000 were made by late 1918 germany fielded very few tanks during world war i and started development only after encountering british tanks on the somme  the a7v the only type made was introduced in march 1918 with just 20 being produced during the war the first tank versus tank action took place on 24 april 1918 at the second battle of villersbretonneux france when three british mark ivs met three german a7vs captured british mk ivs formed the bulk of germanys tank forces during world war i about 35 were in service at any one time plans to expand the tank programme were under way when the war ended the united states tank corps used tanks supplied by france and great britain during world war i production of americanbuilt tanks had just begun when the war came to an end italy also manufactured two fiat 2000s towards the end of the war too late to see service russia independently built and trialed two prototypes early in the war the tracked twoman vezdekhod and the huge lebedenko but neither went into production a tracked selfpropelled gun was also designed but not produced although tank tactics developed rapidly during the war piecemeal deployments mechanical problems and poor mobility limited the military significance of the tank in world war i and the tank did not fulfil its promise of rendering trench warfare obsolete nonetheless it was clear to military thinkers on both sides that tanks in some way could have a significant role in future conflicts in the interwar period tanks underwent further mechanical development in terms of tactics jfc fullers doctrine of spearhead attacks with massed tank formations was the basis for work by heinz guderian in germany percy hobart in britain adna r chaffee jr in the us charles de gaulle in france and mikhail tukhachevsky in the ussr liddell hart held a more moderate view that all arms – cavalry infantry and artillery – should be mechanized and work together the british formed the allarms experimental mechanized force to test the use of tanks with supporting forces in the second world war only germany would initially put the theory into practice on a large scale and it was their superior tactics and french blunders not superior weapons that made the blitzkrieg so successful in may 1940 for information regarding tank development in this period see tank development between the wars germany italy and the soviet union all experimented heavily with tank warfare during their clandestine and volunteer involvement in the spanish civil war which saw some of the earliest examples of successful mechanized combined arms\\xa0—such as when republican troops equipped with sovietsupplied tanks and supported by aircraft eventually routed italian troops fighting for the nationalists in the sevenday battle of guadalajara in 1937 however of the nearly 700 tanks deployed during this conflict only about 64 tanks representing the franco faction and 331 from the republican side were equipped with cannon and of those 64 nearly all were world war i vintage renault ft tanks while the 331 soviet supplied machines had 45mm main guns and were of 1930s manufacture the balance of nationalist tanks were machine gun armed the primary lesson learned from this war was that machine gun armed tanks had to be equipped with cannon with the associated armour inherent to modern tanks the fivemonthlong war between the soviet union and the japanese 6th army at khalkhin gol nomonhan in 1939 brought home some lessonswhich in this conflict the soviets fielded over two thousand tanks to the around 73 cannon armed tanks deployed by the japanese the major difference being that japanese armour were equipped with diesel engines as opposed to the russian tanks equipped with petrol engines after general georgy zhukov inflicted a defeat on the japanese 6th army with his massed combined tank and air attack the soviets learned a lesson on the use of gasoline engines and quickly incorporated those newly found experiences into their new t34 medium tank during world war ii prior to world war ii the tactics and strategy of deploying tank forces underwent a revolution in august 1939 soviet general georgy zhukov used the combined force of tanks and airpower at nomonhan against the japanese 6th army heinz guderian a tactical theoretician who was heavily involved in the formation of the first independent german tank force said where tanks are the front is and this concept became a reality in world war ii guderians armoured warfare ideas combined with germanys existing doctrines of bewegungskrieg maneuver warfare and infiltration tactics from world war i became the basis of blitzkrieg in the opening stages of world war ii during world war ii the first conflict in which armoured vehicles were critical to battlefield success the tank and related tactics developed rapidly armoured forces proved capable of tactical victory in an unprecedentedly short amount of time yet new antitank weaponry showed that the tank was not invulnerable during the invasion of poland tanks performed in a more traditional role in close cooperation with infantry units but in the battle of france deep independent armoured penetrations were executed by the germans a technique later called blitzkrieg blitzkrieg used innovative combined arms tactics and radios in all of the tanks to provide a level of tactical flexibility and power that surpassed that of the allied armour the french army with tanks equal or superior to the german tanks in both quality and quantity employed a linear defensive strategy in which the armoured cavalry units were made subservient to the needs of the infantry armies to cover their entrenchment in belgium in addition they lacked radios in many of their tanks and headquarters which limited their ability to respond to german attacks in accordance with blitzkrieg methods german tanks bypassed enemy strongpoints and could radio for close air support to destroy them or leave them to the infantry a related development motorized infantry allowed some of the troops to keep up with the tanks and create highly mobile combined arms forces the defeat of a major military power within weeks shocked the rest of the world spurring tank and antitank weapon development the north african campaign also provided an important battleground for tanks as the flat desolate terrain with relatively few obstacles or urban environments was ideal for conducting mobile armoured warfare however this battlefield also showed the importance of logistics especially in an armoured force as the principal warring armies the german afrika korps and the british eighth army often outpaced their supply trains in repeated attacks and counterattacks on each other resulting in complete stalemate this situation would not be resolved until 1942 when during the second battle of el alamein the afrika korps crippled by disruptions in their supply lines had 95 of its tanks destroyed and was forced to retreat by a massively reinforced eighth army the first in a series of defeats that would eventually lead to the surrender of the remaining axis forces in tunisia when germany launched its invasion of the soviet union operation barbarossa the soviets had a superior tank design the t34 a lack of preparations for the axis surprise attack mechanical problems poor training of the crews and incompetent leadership caused the soviet machines to be surrounded and destroyed in large numbers however interference from adolf hitler the geographic scale of the conflict the dogged resistance of the soviet combat troops and the soviets massive advantages in manpower and production capability prevented a repeat of the german successes of 1940 despite early successes against the soviets the germans were forced to upgun their panzer ivs and to design and build both the larger and more expensive tiger heavy tank in 1942 and the panther medium tank the following year in doing so the wehrmacht denied the infantry and other support arms the production priorities that they needed to remain equal partners with the increasingly sophisticated tanks in turn violating the principle of combined arms they had pioneered soviet developments following the invasion included upgunning the t34 development of selfpropelled antitank guns such as the su152 and deployment of the is2 in the closing stages of the war with the t34 being the most produced tank of world war ii totalling up to some 65000 examples by may 1945 much like the soviets when entering world war ii six months later december 1941 the united states mass production capacity enabled it to rapidly construct thousands of relatively cheap m4 sherman medium tanks a compromise all round the sherman was reliable and formed a large part of the angloamerican ground forces but in a tankversustank battle was no match for the panther or tiger numerical and logistical superiority and the successful use of combined arms allowed the allies to overrun the german forces during the battle of normandy upgunned versions with the 76 mm gun m1 and the 17pounder were introduced to improve the m4s firepower but concerns about protection remained—despite the apparent armour deficiencies a total of some 42000 shermans were built and delivered to the allied nations using it during the war years a total second only to the t34 tank hulls were modified to produce flame tanks mobile rocket artillery and combat engineering vehicles for tasks including mineclearing and bridging specialized selfpropelled guns most of which could double as tank destroyers were also both developed by the germans—with their sturmgeschütz panzerjäger and jagdpanzer vehicles—and the samokhodnaya ustanovka families of afvs for the soviets such turretless casematestyle tank destroyers and assault guns were less complex stripped down tanks carrying heavy guns solely firing forward the firepower and low cost of these vehicles made them attractive but as manufacturing techniques improved and larger turret rings made larger tank guns feasible the gun turret was recognized as the most effective mounting for the main gun to allow movement in a different direction from firing enhancing tactical flexibility during the cold war tension between the warsaw pact countries and north atlantic treaty organization nato countries created an arms race that ensured that tank development proceeded largely as it had during world war ii the essence of tank designs during the cold war had been hammered out in the closing stages of world war ii large turrets capable suspension systems greatly improved engines sloped armour and largecaliber 90\\xa0mm and larger guns were standard tank design during the cold war built on this foundation and included improvements to fire control gyroscopic gun stabilization communications primarily radio and crew comfort and saw the introduction of laser rangefinders and infrared night vision equipment armour technology progressed in an ongoing race against improvements in antitank weapons especially antitank guided missiles like the tow medium tanks of world war ii evolved into the main battle tank mbt of the cold war and took over the majority of tank roles on the battlefield this gradual transition occurred in the 1950s and 1960s due to antitank guided missiles sabot ammunition and highexplosive antitank warheads world war ii had shown that the speed of a light tank was no substitute for armour  firepower and medium tanks were vulnerable to newer weapon technology rendering them obsoletecitation needed in a trend started in world war ii economies of scale led to serial production of progressively upgraded models of all major tanks during the cold war for the same reason many upgraded postworld war ii tanks and their derivatives for example the t55 and t72 remain in active service around the world and even an obsolete tank may be the most formidable weapon on battlefields in many parts of the world among the tanks of the 1950s were the british centurion and soviet t5455 in service from 1946 and the us m48 from 1951 these three vehicles formed the bulk of the armoured forces of nato and the warsaw pact throughout much of the cold war lessons learned from tanks such as the leopard 1 m48 patton series chieftain and t72 led to the contemporary leopard 2 m1 abrams challenger 2 c1 ariete t90 and merkava iv tanks and antitank weapons of the cold war era saw action in a number of proxy wars like the korean war vietnam war indopakistani war of 1971 soviet–afghan war and arabisraeli conflicts culminating with the yom kippur war the t55 for example has seen action in no fewer than 32 conflicts in these wars the us or nato countries and the soviet union or china consistently backed opposing forces proxy wars were studied by western and soviet military analysts and provided a contribution to the cold war tank development process the role of tank vs tank combat is becoming diminished tanks work in concert with infantry in urban warfare by deploying them ahead of the platoon when engaging enemy infantry tanks can provide covering fire on the battlefield conversely tanks can spearhead attacks when infantry are deployed in personnel carriers tanks were used to spearhead the initial us invasion of iraq in 2003 as of 2005 there were 1100 m1 abrams used by the united states army in the course of the iraq war and they have proven to have an unexpectedly high level of vulnerability to roadside bombs a relatively new type of remotely detonated mine the explosively formed penetrator has been used with some success against american armoured vehicles particularly the bradley fighting vehicle however with upgrades to their armour in the rear m1s have proven invaluable in fighting insurgents in urban combat particularly at the battle of fallujah where the us marines brought in two extra brigades israeli merkava tanks contain features that enable them to support infantry in low intensity conflicts lic and counterterrorism operations such features are the rear door and rear corridor enabling the tank to carry infantry and embark safely the imi apammpt multipurpose ammunition round advanced c4is systems and recently trophy active protection system which protects the tank from shoulderlaunched antitank weapons during the second intifada further modifications were made designated as merkava mk 3d baz liccitation needed in terms of firepower the focus of 2010sera rd was increased detection capability such as thermal imagers automated fire control systems for the guns and increased muzzle energy from the gun to improve range accuracy and armour penetration the most mature future gun technology is the electrothermalchemical gun the xm291 electrothermalchemical tank gun has gone through successful multiple firing sequences on a modified american m8 armored gun system chassis to improve tank protection one field of research involves making the tank invisible to radar by adapting stealth technologies originally designed for aircraft improvements to camouflage or and attempts to render it invisible through active camouflage which changes according to where the tank is located are being pursued research is also ongoing in electromagnetic armour systems to disperse or deflect incoming shaped charges as well as various forms of active protection systems to prevent incoming projectiles rpgs missiles etc from striking the tank mobility may be enhanced in future tanks by the use of dieselelectric or turbineelectric series hybrid drives—first used in a primitive gasolineengined form with porsches elefant german tank destroyer of 1943—improving fuel efficiency while reducing the size and weight of the power plant furthermore advances in gas turbine technology including the use of advanced recuperators have allowed for reduction in engine volume and mass to less than 1 m3 and 1 metric ton respectively while maintaining fuel efficiency similar to that of a diesel engine in line with the new doctrine of networkcentric warfare the 2010sera modern battle tank shows increasing sophistication in its electronics and communication systems the future of tanks has been challenged by the proliferation of relatively inexpensive anti tank guided missiles and rockets during the russoukrainian war the three traditional factors determining a tanks capability effectiveness are its firepower protection and mobility firepower is the ability of a tanks crew to identify engage and destroy enemy tanks and other targets using its largecaliber cannon protection is the degree to which the tanks armour profile and camouflage enables the tank crew to evade detection protect themselves from enemy fire and retain vehicle functionality during and after combat mobility includes how well the tank can be transported by rail sea or air to the operational staging area from the staging area by road or over terrain towards the enemy and tactical movement by the tank over the battlefield during combat including traversing of obstacles and rough terrain the variations of tank designs have been determined by the way these three fundamental features are blended for instance in 1937 the french doctrine focused on firepower and protection more than mobility because tanks worked in intimate liaison with the infantry there was also the case of the development of a heavy cruiser tank which focused on armour and firepower to challenge germanys tiger and panther tanks tanks have been classified by weight role or other criteria that has changed over time and place classification is determined by the prevailing theories of armoured warfare which have been altered in turn by rapid advances in technology no one classification system works across all periods or all nations in particular weightbased classification is inconsistent between countries and eras in world war i the first tank designs focused on crossing wide trenches requiring very long and large vehicles such as the british mark i these became classified as heavy tanks tanks that fulfilled other combat roles were smaller like the french renault ft these were classified as light tanks or tankettes many latewar and interwar tank designs diverged from these according to new though mostly untried concepts for future tank roles and tactics tank classifications varied considerably according to each nations own tank development such as cavalry tanks fast tanks and breakthrough tanks during world war ii many tank concepts were found unsatisfactory and discarded mostly leaving the more multirole tanks these became easier to classify tank classes based on weight and the corresponding transport and logistical needs led to new definitions of heavy and light tank classes with medium tanks covering the balance of those between the british maintained cruiser tanks focused on speed and infantry tanks that traded speed for more armour tank destroyers are tanks or other armoured fighting vehicles specifically designed to defeat enemy tanks assault guns are armoured fighting vehicles that could combine the roles of infantry tanks and tank destroyers some tanks were converted to flame tanks specializing on closein attacks on enemy strongholds with flamethrowers as the war went on tanks tended to become larger and more powerful shifting some tank classifications and leading to superheavy tanks experience and technology advances during the cold war continued to consolidate tank roles with the worldwide adoption of the modern main battle tank designs which favour a modular universal design most other classifications are dropped from modern terminology all main battle tanks tend to have a good balance of speed armour and firepower even while technology continues to improve all three being fairly large main battle tanks can be complemented with light tanks armoured personnel carriers infantry fighting vehicles or similar relatively lighter armoured fighting vehicles typically in the roles of armoured reconnaissance amphibious or air assault operations or against enemies lacking main battle tanks the main weapon of modern tanks is typically a single largecaliber cannon mounted in a fully traversing rotating gun turret the typical modern tank gun is a smoothbore weapon capable of firing a variety of ammunition including armourpiercing kinetic energy penetrators kep also known as armourpiercing discarding sabot apds andor armourpiercing finstabilized discarding sabot apfsds and highexplosive antitank heat shells andor highexplosive squash head hesh andor antitank guided missiles atgm to destroy armoured targets as well as highexplosive he shells for shooting at soft targets unarmoured vehicles or troops or fortifications canister shot may be used in close or urban combat situations where the risk of hitting friendly forces with shrapnel from he rounds is unacceptably high a gyroscope is used to stabilise the main gun allowing it to be effectively aimed and fired at the short halt or on the move modern tank guns are also commonly fitted with insulating thermal sleeves to reduce gunbarrel warping caused by uneven thermal expansion bore evacuators to minimise gun firing fumes entering the crew compartment and sometimes muzzle brakes to minimise the effect of recoil on accuracy and rate of fire traditionally target detection relied on visual identification this was accomplished from within the tank through telescopic periscopes often however tank commanders would open up the hatch to view the outside surroundings which improved situational awareness but incurred the penalty of vulnerability to sniper fire though several developments in target detection have taken place these methods are still common practice in the 2010s more electronic target detection methods are available in some cases spotting rifles were used to confirm proper trajectory and range to a target these spotting rifles were mounted coaxially to the main gun and fired tracer ammunition ballistically matched to the gun itself the gunner would track the movement of the tracer round in flight and upon impact with a hard surface it would give off a flash and a puff of smoke after which the main gun was immediately fired however this slow method has been mostly superseded by laser rangefinding equipment modern tanks also use sophisticated light intensification and thermal imaging equipment to improve fighting capability at night in poor weather and in smoke the accuracy of modern tank guns is pushed to the mechanical limit by computerized firecontrol systems a firecontrol system uses a laser rangefinder to determine the range to the target a thermocouple anemometer and wind vane to correct for weather effects and a muzzle referencing system to correct for gunbarrel temperature warping and wear two sightings of a target with the rangefinder enable calculation of the target movement vector this information is combined with the known movement of the tank and the principles of ballistics to calculate the elevation and aim point that maximises the probability of hitting the target usually tanks carry smaller caliber armament for shortrange defense where fire from the main weapon would be ineffective or wasteful for example when engaging infantry light vehicles or close air support aircraft a typical complement of secondary weapons is a generalpurpose machine gun mounted coaxially with the main gun and a heavier antiaircraftcapable machine gun on the turret roof some tanks also have a hullmounted machine gun these weapons are often modified variants of those used by infantry and so use the same kinds of ammunition the measure of a tanks protection is the combination of its ability to avoid detection due to having a low profile and through the use of camouflage to avoid being hit by enemy fire its resistance to the effects of enemy fire and its capacity to sustain damage whilst still completing its objective or at least protecting its crew this is done by a variety of countermeasures such as armour plating and reactive defenses as well as more complex ones such as heatemissions reduction in common with most unit types tanks are subject to additional hazards in dense wooded and urban combat environments which largely negate the advantages of the tanks longrange firepower and mobility limit the crews detection capabilities and can restrict turret traverse despite these disadvantages tanks retain high survivability against previousgeneration rocketpropelled grenades aimed at the mostarmoured sections however as effective and advanced as armour plating has become tank survivability against newergeneration tandemwarhead antitank missiles is a concern for military planners tandemwarhead rpgs use two warheads to fool active protection systems a first dummy warhead is fired first to trigger the active defenses with the real warhead following it for example the rpg29 from the 1980s is able to penetrate the frontal hull armour of the challenger ii and also managed to damage a m1 abrams as well even tanks with advanced armour plating can have their tracks or gear cogs damaged by rpgs which may render them immobile or hinder their mobility despite all of the advances in armour plating a tank with its hatches open remains vulnerable to molotov cocktail gasoline bombs and grenades even a buttoned up tank may have components which are vulnerable to molotov cocktails such as optics extra gas cans and extra ammunition stored on the outside of the tank a tank avoids detection using the doctrine of countermeasures known as ccd camouflage looks the same as the surroundings concealment cannot be seen and deception looks like something else camouflage can include disruptive painted shapes on the tank to break up the distinctive appearance and silhouette of a tank netting or actual branches from the surrounding landscape are also used prior to development of infrared technology tanks were often given a coating of camouflage paint that depending on environmental region or season would allow it to blend in with the rest of its environment a tank operating in wooded areas would typically get a green and brown paintjob a tank in a winter environment would get white paint often mixed with some darker colors tanks in the desert often get khaki paintjobs the russian nakidka camouflage kit was designed to reduce the optical thermal infrared and radar signatures of a tank so that acquisition of the tank would be difficult according to nii stali the designers of nakidka nakidka would reduce the probabilities of detection via visual and nearir bands by 30 the thermal band by 2–3fold radar band by 6fold and radarthermal band to nearbackground levels concealment can include hiding the tank among trees or digging in the tank by having a combat bulldozer dig out part of a hill so that much of the tank will be hidden a tank commander can conceal the tank by using hull down approaches to going over upwardsloping hills so that she or he can look out the commanders cupola without the distinctivelooking main cannon cresting over the hill adopting a turretdown or hulldown position reduces the visible silhouette of a tank as well as providing the added protection of a position in defilade working against efforts to avoid detection is the fact that a tank is a large metallic object with a distinctive angular silhouette that emits copious heat and engine noise a tank that is operating in cold weather or which needs to use its radio or other communications or targetdetecting electronics will need to start its engine regularly to maintain its battery power which will create engine noise consequently it is difficult to effectively camouflage a tank in the absence of some form of cover or concealment eg woods it can hide its hull behind the tank becomes easier to detect when moving typically whenever it is in use due to the large distinctive auditory vibration and thermal signature of its engine and power plant tank tracks and dust clouds also betray past or present tank movement switchedoff tanks are vulnerable to infrared detection due to differences between the thermal conductivity and therefore heat dissipation of the metallic tank and its surroundings at close range the tank can be detected even when powered down and fully concealed due to the column of warmer air above the tank and the smell of diesel or gasoline thermal blankets slow the rate of heat emission and some thermal camouflage nets use a mix of materials with differing thermal properties to operate in the infrared as well as the visible spectrum grenade launchers can rapidly deploy a smoke screen that is opaque to infrared light to hide it from the thermal viewer of another tank in addition to using its own grenade launchers a tank commander could call in an artillery unit to provide smoke cover some tanks can produce a smoke screen sometimes camouflage and concealment are used at the same time for example a camouflagepainted and branchcovered tank camouflage may be hidden in a behind a hill or in a duginemplacement concealment some armoured recovery vehicles often tracked tank chassisbased tow trucks for tanks have dummy turrets and cannons this makes it less likely that enemy tanks will fire on these vehicles some armies have fake dummy tanks made of wood which troops can carry into position and hide behind obstacles these dummy tanks may cause the enemy to think that there are more tanks than are actually possessed to effectively protect the tank and its crew tank armour must counter a wide variety of antitank threats protection against kinetic energy penetrators and highexplosive antitank heat shells fired by other tanks is of primary importance but tank armour also aims to protect against infantry mortars grenades rocketpropelled grenades antitank guided missiles antitank mines antitank rifles bombs direct artillery hits and less often nuclear biological and chemical threats any of which could disable or destroy a tank or its crew steel armour plate was the earliest type of armour the germans pioneered the use of face hardened steel during world war ii and the soviets also achieved improved protection with sloped armour technology world war ii developments led to the obsolescence of homogeneous steel armour with the development of shapedcharge warheads exemplified by the panzerfaust and bazooka infantrycarried weapons which were effective despite some early success with spaced armour magnetic mines led to the development of antimagnetic paste and paint from wwii to the modern era troops have added improvised armour to tanks while in combat settings such as sandbags or pieces of old armour plating british tank researchers took the next step with the development of chobham armour or more generally composite armour incorporating ceramics and plastics in a resin matrix between steel plates which provided good protection against heat weapons highexplosive squash head warheads led to antispall armour linings and kinetic energy penetrators led to the inclusion of exotic materials like a matrix of depleted uranium into a composite armour configuration reactive armour consists of small explosivefilled metal boxes that detonate when hit by the metallic jet projected by an exploding heat warhead causing their metal plates to disrupt it tandem warheads defeat reactive armour by causing the armour to detonate prematurely modern reactive armour protects itself from tandem warheads by having a thicker front metal plate to prevent the precursor charge from detonating the explosive in the reactive armour reactive armours can also reduce the penetrative abilities of kinetic energy penetrators by deforming the penetrator with the metal plates on the reactive armour thereby reducing its effectiveness against the main armour of the tank the latest generation of protective measures for tanks are active protection systems the term active is used to contrast these approaches with the armour used as the primary protective approach in earlier tanks the mobility of a tank is described by its battlefield or tactical mobility its operational mobility and its strategic mobility tank agility is a function of the weight of the tank due to its inertia while manoeuvring and its ground pressure the power output of the installed power plant and the tank transmission and track design in addition rough terrain effectively limits the tanks speed through the stress it puts on the suspension and the crew a breakthrough in this area was achieved during world war ii when improved suspension systems were developed that allowed better crosscountry performance and limited firing on the move systems like the earlier christie or later torsionbar suspension developed by ferdinand porsche dramatically improved the tanks crosscountry performance and overall mobility tanks are highly mobile and able to travel over most types of terrain due to their continuous tracks and advanced suspension the tracks disperse the weight of the vehicle over a large area resulting in less ground pressure a tank can travel at approximately 40 kilometres per hour 25\\xa0mph across flat terrain and up to 70 kilometres per hour 43\\xa0mph on roads but due to the mechanical strain this places on the vehicle and the logistical strain on fuel delivery and tank maintenance these must be considered burst speeds that invite mechanical failure of engine and transmission systems consequently wheeled tank transporters and rail infrastructure is used wherever possible for longdistance tank transport the limitations of longrange tank mobility can be viewed in sharp contrast to that of wheeled armoured fighting vehicles the majority of blitzkrieg operations were conducted at the pedestrian pace of 5 kilometres per hour 31\\xa0mph and that was only achieved on the roads of france the tanks power plant supplies kinetic energy to move the tank and electric power via a generator to components such as the turret rotation motors and the tanks electronic systems the tank power plant evolved from predominantly petrol and adapted largedisplacement aeronautical or automotive engines to diesel engines japan was the first to begin transitioning to this engine type beginning with the type 89b in 1934 the main advantage of diesel is their higher fuel economy which allows for greater operating ranges diesel engines can also run on a variety of fuels such as aviation kerosene and even gasoline advanced multifuel diesel engines have been adopted powerful per unit weight but fuelhungry gas turbines have seen some limited use namely by the soviet t80 and american m1 abrams the transition from petrol to diesel in the absence of combat engineers most tanks are limited to fording small rivers the typical fording depth for mbts is approximately 1\\xa0m 33\\xa0ft being limited by the height of the engine air intake and drivers position modern tanks such as the russian t90 and the german leopard 1 and leopard 2 tanks can ford to a depth of 3 to 4\\xa0m 98 to 131\\xa0ft when properly prepared and equipped with a snorkel to supply air for the crew and engine tank crews usually have a negative reaction towards deep fording but it adds considerable scope for surprise and tactical flexibility in water crossing operations by opening new and unexpected avenues of attack amphibious tanks are specially designed or adapted for water operations such as by including snorkels and skirts but they are rare in modern armies being replaced by purposebuilt amphibious assault vehicles or armoured personnel carriers in amphibious assaults advances such as the efa mobile bridge and armoured vehiclelaunched scissors bridges have also reduced the impediment to tank advance that rivers posed in world war ii most modern tanks most often have four crew members or three if an autoloader is installed  these are the operating a tank is a team effort for example the loader is assisted by the rest of the crew in stowing ammunition the driver is assisted in maintaining the automotive features historically crews have varied from just two members to a dozen first world war tanks were developed with immature technologies in addition to the crew needed to man the multiple guns and machine guns up to four crewmen were needed to drive the tank the driver acting as the vehicle commander and manning the brakes drove via orders to his gearsmen a codriver operated the gearbox and throttle and two gearsmen one on each track steered by setting one side or the other to idle allowing the track on the other side to slew the tank to one side  preworld war ii french tanks were noted for having a twoman crew in which the overworked commander had to load and fire the gun in addition to commanding the tank with world war ii the multiturreted tanks proved impracticable and as the single turret on a low hull design became standard crews became standardized around a crew of four or five in those tanks with a fifth crew member usually three were located in the turret as described above while the fifth was most often seated in the hull next to the driver and operated the hull machine gun in addition to acting as a codriver or radio operator welldesigned crew stations giving proper considerations to comfort and ergonomics are an important factor in the combat effectiveness of a tank as it limits fatigue and speeds up individual actions a noted author on the subject of tank design engineering richard ogorkiewicz outlined the following basic engineering subsystems that are commonly incorporated into tanks technological developmentpage\\xa0needed to the above can be added unit communication systems and electronic antitank countermeasures crew ergonomic and survival systems including flame suppression and provision for technological upgrading\\nfew tank designs have survived their entire service lives without some upgrading or modernization particularly during wartime including some that have changed almost beyond recognition such as the latest israeli magach versions the characteristics of a tank are determined by the performance criteria required for the tank the obstacles that must be traversed affect the vehicles front and rear profiles the terrain that is expected to be traversed determines the track ground pressure that may be allowed to be exerted for that particular terrain tank design is a compromise between its technological and budgetary constraints and its tactical capability requirements it is not possible to maximise firepower protection and mobility simultaneously while incorporating the latest technology and retain affordability for sufficient procurement quantity to enter production\\nfor example in the case of tactical capability requirements increasing protection by adding armour will result in an increase in weight and therefore decrease in mobility increasing firepower by installing a larger gun will force the designer team to increase armour the therefore weight of the tank by retaining same internal volume to ensure crew efficiency during combat in the case of the abrams mbt which has good firepower speed and armour these advantages are counterbalanced by its engines notably high fuel consumption which ultimately reduces its range and in a larger sense its mobility since the second world war the economics of tank production governed by the complexity of manufacture and cost and the impact of a given tank design on logistics and field maintenance capabilities have also been accepted as important in determining how many tanks a nation can afford to field in its force structure some tank designs that were fielded in significant numbers such as tiger i and m60a2 proved to be too complex or expensive to manufacture and made unsustainable demands on the logistics services support of the armed forces the affordability of the design therefore takes precedence over the combat capability requirements\\nnowhere was this principle illustrated better than during the second world war when two allied designs the t34 and the m4 sherman although both simple designs which accepted engineering compromises were used successfully against more sophisticated designs by germany that were more complex and expensive to produce and more demanding on overstretched logistics of the wehrmacht given that a tank crew will spend most of its time occupied with maintenance of the vehicle engineering simplicity has become the primary constraint on tank design since the second world war despite advances in mechanical electrical and electronics technologies since the second world war tank development has incorporated experimenting with significant mechanical changes to the tank design while focusing on technological advances in the tanks many subsystems to improve its performance however a number of novel designs have appeared throughout this period with mixed success including the soviet it1 and t64 in firepower and the israeli merkava and swedish stank in protection while for decades the uss m551 remained the only light tank deployable by parachute commanding and coordinating tanks in the field has always been subject to particular problems particularly in the area of communications but in modern armies these problems have been partially alleviated by networked integrated systems that enable communications and contribute to enhanced situational awareness armoured bulkheads engine noise intervening terrain dust and smoke and the need to operate buttoned up with hatches closed are severe detriments to communication and lead to a sense of isolation for small tank units individual vehicles and tank crew radios were not then portable or robust enough to be mounted in a tank although morse code transmitters were installed in some mark ivs at cambrai as messaging vehicles attaching a field telephone to the rear would become a practice only during the next war during world war i when these failed or were unavailable situation reports were sent back to headquarters by some crews releasing carrier pigeons through loopholes or hatches and communications between vehicles was accomplished using hand signals handheld semaphore flags which continued in use in the red armysoviet army through the second and cold wars or by foot or horsemounted messengers from the beginning the german military stressed wireless communications equipping their combat vehicles with radios and drilled all units to rely on disciplined radio use as a basic element of tactics  this allowed them to respond to developing threats and opportunities during battles giving the germans a notable tactical advantage early in the war even where allied tanks initially had better firepower and armour they generally lacked individual radios by midwar western allied tanks adopted full use of radios although russian use of radios remained relatively limited on the modern battlefield an intercom mounted in the crew helmet provides internal communications and a link to the radio network and on some tanks an external intercom on the rear of the tank provides communication with cooperating infantry radio networks employ radio voice procedure to minimize confusion and chatter\\na recentwhen development in afv equipment and doctrine is integration of information from the fire control system laser rangefinder global positioning system and terrain information via hardened military specification electronics and a battlefield network to display information on enemy targets and friendly units on a monitor in the tank the sensor data can be sourced from nearby tanks planes uavs or in the future infantry such as the us future force warrior project this improves the tank commanders situational awareness and ability to navigate the battlefield and select and engage targets in addition to easing the reporting burden by automatically logging all orders and actions orders are sent via the network with text and graphical overlays this is known as networkcentric warfare by the us network enabled capability uk or digital army battle management system ציד israel advanced battle tanks including the k2 black panther have taken up the first major step forward in adopting a fully radar integrated fire control system which allows it to detect tanks from a further distance and identify it as a friendorfoe as well as increasing the tanks accuracy as well as its capability to lock onto tanks performing situational awareness and communication is the one of four primary mbt functions in the 21st century \\nto improve the crews situational awareness mbts use circular review system with a combination of augmented reality and artificial intelligence technologies further advancements in tank defense systems have led to the development of active protection systems these involve either one of two options background history of the tank tank classification tanks in world war i background history of the tank tank classification interwar

anomalous classification the galyat tracts were first discovered by early british colonial officials such as james abbott who ventured into these areas circa 1846–47 the british found them climatically conducive to them and began to develop some of the sites in the rangetract as hill resorts to escape the summer heat of the lowlands later on after partitionindependence of pakistan in

desert also known as the great indian desert is an arid region in the northwestern part of the indian subcontinent that covers an area of 200000\\xa0km2 77000\\xa0sq\\xa0mi in india and pakistan it is the worlds 18thlargest desert and the worlds 9thlargest hot subtropical desert about 85 of the thar desert is in india and about 15 is in pakistan  the thar desert is about 456 of the total geographical area of india more than 60 of the desert lies in the indian state of rajasthan the portion in india also extends into gujarat punjab and haryana the portion in pakistan extends into the provinces of sindh and punjab the portion in the latter province is referred to as the cholistan desert the indogangetic plain lies to the north west and northeast of the thar desert the rann of kutch lies to its south and the aravali range borders the desert to the east the most recent paleontological discovery in 2023 from the thar desert in india dating back to 167 million years ago pertains to a herbivorous dinosaur group known as dicraeosaurids this discovery marks the first of its kind to be unearthed in india and is also the oldest specimen of the group ever recorded in the global fossil record during the last glacial maximum 20000 before present an approximately 2400000 square kilometres 930000\\xa0sq\\xa0mi ice sheet covered the tibetan plateau causing excessive radiative forcing ie the ice in tibet reflected at least four times more radiation energy per unit area into space than ice at higher latitudes which  further cooled overlying atmosphere at that time this impacted the regional climate without the thermal low pressure caused by the heating there was no monsoon over the indian subcontinent this lack of monsoon caused extensive rainfall over the sahara expansion of the thar desert more dust deposited into the arabian sea a lowering of the biotic life zones on the indian subcontinent and animals responded to this shift in climate with the javan rusa deer migrating into india 100008000 years ago a paleo channel of ghaggarhakra river  identified with the paleo sarasvati river after confluence with sutlej flowed into the nara river  a delta channel of the indus river changed its course leaving the ghaggarhakra as a system of monsoonfed rivers which did not reach the sea and now ends in the thar desert around 5000 years ago when the monsoons that fed the rivers diminished further the indus valley civilisation ivc prospered in this areab with the rise of numerous ivc urban sites at kalibangan rajasthan banawali and rakhigarhi haryana dholavira and lothal gujarat along this courseweb 1 4000 years ago when monsoons diminished even further the driedup harkra become an intermittent river and the urban harappan civilisation declined becoming localized in smaller agricultural communitiesc the northeastern part of the thar desert lies between the aravalli hills the desert stretches to punjab and haryana in the north to the great rann of kutch along the coast and to the alluvial plains of the indus river in the west and northwest much of the desert area is covered by huge shifting sand dunes that receive sediments from the alluvial plains and the coast the sand is highly mobile due to the strong winds that rise each year before the onset of the monsoon the luni river is the only river in the desert rainfall is 100 to 500\\xa0mm 4 to 20\\xa0in per year almost all of it between june and september saltwater lakes within the thar desert include the sambhar kuchaman didwana pachpadra and phalodi in rajasthan and kharaghoda in gujarat these lakes receive and collect rainwater during monsoon and evaporate during the dry season the salt comes from the weathering of rocks in the region lithic tools belonging to the prehistoric aterian culture of the maghreb have been discovered in middle paleolithic deposits in the thar desert the climate is arid and subtropical average temperature varies with season and extremes can range from nearfreezing in the winter to more than 50º c in the summer months average annual rainfall ranges from 100 to 500 mm and occurs during the short julytoseptember southwest monsoon the desert has both a very dry part the marusthali region in the west and a semidesert part in the east that has fewer sand dunes and slightly more precipitation the soil of the thar desert remains dry for much of the year so it is prone to wind erosion highvelocity winds blow soil from the desert depositing some of it on neighboring fertile lands and causing sand dunes within the desert to shift to counteract this problem sand dunes are stabilised by first erecting microwindbreak barriers with scrub material and then by afforestation of the treated dunes—planting the seedlings of shrubs such as phog senna and castor oil plant and trees such as gum acacia prosopis juliflora and lebbek tree the 649kmlong indira gandhi canal brings fresh water to the thar desert it was built to halt any spreading of the desert into fertile areas there are several protected areas in the thar desert some wildlife species that are fast vanishing in other parts of india are found in the desert in large numbers including the blackbuck antilope cervicapra chinkara gazella bennettiiand indian wild ass equus hemionus khur in the rann of kutch this may be partly because they are well adapted to this environment they are smaller than similar animals that live in other environments and they are mainly nocturnal it may also be because grasslands in this region have not been transformed into cropland as fast as in other regions and because a local community the bishnois has made special efforts to protect them other mammals in the thar desert include a subspecies of red fox vulpes vulpes pusilla and the caracal and a number of reptiles dwell there too the region is a haven for 141 species of migratory and resident desert birds including harriers falcons buzzards kestrels vultures shorttoed eagles circaetus

a mountain pass in the khyber pakhtunkhwa province of pakistan on the border with the nangarhar province of afghanistan it connects the town of landi kotal to the valley of peshawar at jamrud by traversing part of the white mountains since it was part of the ancient silk road it has been a vital trade route between central asia and the indian subcontinent and a strategic military choke point for various states that controlled it the khyber pass is considered one of the most famous mountain passes in the world the inhabitants of the area are predominantly from the afridi and shinwari tribes of pashtuns following asian highway 1 ah1 the summit of the pass at the town of landi kotal is five kilometres three miles inside pakistan descending 460\\xa0m 1510\\xa0ft into the valley of

khyber pass such as those of cyrus darius i genghis khan and later mongols such as duwa qutlugh khwaja and kebek prior to the kushan era the khyber pass was not a widely used trade route the khyber pass became a critical part of the silk road a major trade route from east asia to europe the parthian empire fought for control of passes such as this to profit from the trade in silk jade rhubarb and other luxuries moving from china to western asia and europe through the khyber pass gandhara in presentday pakistan became a regional center of trade connecting bagram in afghanistan to taxila in pakistan adding indian luxury goods such as ivory pepper and textiles to the silk road commerce\\u200a74 among the muslim invasions of the indian subcontinent through the khyber pass were mahmud ghaznavi muhammad ghori and the turkicmongols finally sikhs under ranjit singh captured the khyber pass in 1834  a common phrase at the time described the length of what was then india as khyber to kanyakumari to the north of the khyber pass lies the country of the shalmani tribe and mullagori tribe to the south is afridi tirah while the inhabitants of villages in the pass itself are afridi clansmen throughout the centuries pashtun clans particularly the afridis and the afghan shinwaris have regarded the pass as their own preserve and have levied a toll on travellers for safe conduct since this has long been their main source of income resistance to challenges to the shinwaris authority has often been fierce the khyber pass came under british rule in march 1849 after the region was ceded to the british by dost mohammad khan for strategic reasons after the first world war the government of british india built a heavily engineered railway through the pass the khyber pass railway from jamrud near peshawar to the afghan border near landi kotal was opened in 1925 during world war ii concrete dragons teeth were erected on the valley floor due to british fears of a german tank invasion of india the pass became widely known to thousands of westerners and japanese who traveled it in the days of the hippie trail taking a bus or car from kabul to the afghan border  at the pakistani frontier post travellers were advised not to wander away from the road as the location was a barely controlled federally administered tribal area  then after customs formalities a quick daylight drive through the pass was made  monuments left by british indian army units from the time of british colonialism as well as hillside forts could be viewed from the highway\\nthe area of the khyber pass has been connected with a counterfeit arms industry that makes various types of weapons known to gun collectors as khyber pass copies using local steel and blacksmiths forgescitation needed during the war in afghanistan the khyber pass was a major route for resupplying military armament and food to nato forces in the afghan theater of conflict since the us started the invasion of afghanistan in 2001 almost 80 percent of the nato and us supplies that were brought in by road were transported through the khyber pass it was also used to transport civilians from the afghan side to the pakistani one until the end of 2007 the route had been relatively safe since the tribes living there mainly the afridi a pashtun tribe were paid by the pakistani government to keep the area safe however after that year the taliban began to control the region and so wider tensions started to exist in theirspecify political relationshipcitation needed since the end of 2008 supply convoys and depots in this western part had increasingly come under attack by elements from or supposedly sympathetic to the pakistani talibancitation needed in january 2009 pakistan sealed off the bridge as part of a military offensive against taliban guerrillas this military operation was mainly focused on jamrud a district on the khyber road the target was to “dynamite or bulldoze homes belonging to men suspected of harboring or supporting taliban militants or carrying out other illegal activities” the result meant that more than 70 people were arrested and 45 homes were destroyed in addition two children and one woman were killed as a response in early february 2009 taliban insurgents cut off the khyber pass temporarily by blowing up a key bridgecitation needed this increasingly unstable situation in northwest pakistan made the us and nato broaden supply routes through central asia turkmenistan uzbekistan and tajikistan even the option of supplying material through the iranian far southeastern port of chabahar was considered in 2010 the already complicated relationship with pakistan always accused by the us of hosting the taliban in this border area without reporting it became tougher after the nato forces under the pretext of mitigating the talibans power over this area executed an attack with drones over the durand line passing the frontier of afghanistan and killing three pakistani soldiers pakistan answered by closing the pass on 30 september which caused a convoy of several nato trucks to queue at the closed border this convoy was attacked by extremists apparently linked to al qaida which caused the destruction of more than 29 oil tankers and trucks and the killing of several soldiers nato chief members had to issue a formal apology to the pakistani government so the supply traffic at this pass could be restoredcitation needed in august 2011 the activity at the khyber pass was again halted by the khyber agency administration due to the more possible attacks of the insurgency over the nato forces which had suffered a period of large number of assaults over the trucks heading to supply the nato and isaf coalitions all over the frontier

locally known as rohi روہی is a desert in the southern part of punjab pakistan that forms part of the greater thar desert which extends to sindh province and the indian state of rajasthan it is one of two large deserts in punjab the other being the thal desert the name is derived from the turkic word chol meaning sands and istan a persian suffix meaning land of cholistan was a center for caravan trade leading to the construction of numerous forts in the medieval period to protect trade routes  of which the derawar fort is the bestpreserved example cholistan covers an area of 25800\\xa0km2

sandy while 19 is characterized by alluvial flats and small sandy dunes the entire region is subject to desertification due to poor vegetation cover resulting in wind erosion cholistans climate is characterized as an arid and semiarid tropical desert with very low annual humidity the mean temperature in cholistan is 2833\\xa0°c 8299\\xa0°f with the hottest month being july with a mean temperature of 385\\xa0°c 1013\\xa0°f summer temperatures can surpass 46\\xa0°c 115\\xa0°f and sometimes rise over 50\\xa0°c 122\\xa0°f during periods of drought winter temperatures occasionally dip

called toba or manmade pools called kund subsoil water is found at a depth of 30–40 meters but is typically brackish and unsuitable for most plant growth in may 2022 in the desert areas of cholistan in pakistan many cattle died due to extreme heat and water shortage shepherds including cattle have started migrating from waterscarce areas toba salem sar and toba nawa kahu were the worst affected areas where 50 sheep died due to lack of water while more data is being collected from the affected areas cholistan was formed during the pleistocene period geologically cholistan is divided into the greater cholistan and lesser cholistan which are roughly divided by the dry bed of the ancient hakra river greater cholistan is a mostly sandy area in the south and west part of the desert up to the border with india and covers an area of 13600\\xa0km2 5300\\xa0sq\\xa0mi sand dunes in this area reach over 100 meters in height soil in the region is also highly saline lesser cholistan is an arid and slightly less sandy region approximately 12370\\xa0km2 4780\\xa0sq\\xa0mi in area which extends north and east from the old hakra river bed historically up to the banks of the sutlej river soil quality is generally poor with little organic matter in the greater cholistan and compacted alluvial clays in the lesser cholistan a canal system built during the british era led to irrigation of the northern part of lesser cholistan though now an arid region cholistan once had a large river flowing through it that was formed by the waters of the sutlej and yamuna rivers the dry bed of the hakra river runs through the area along which many settlements of the indus valley civilizationharappan culture have been discovered including the large urban site of ganweriwal the river system supported settlements in the region between 4000 bce and 600 bce when the river changed course the river carried significant amounts of water and flowed until at least where derawar fort is now located over 400 harappan sites had been listed in cholistan in the 1970s with a further 37 added in the 1990s the high density of settlements in cholistan suggest it may have been one of the most productive regions of the indus valley civilization in the postharappan period cholistan was part of the cemetery h culture which grew as a surviving regional variant of the harappan culture which was then followed by the painted grey ware culture the region became a center for caravan trade leading to the construction of a dense network of forts in the medieval period  of which the derawar fort is the bestpreserved example other large forts in cholistan include meergarh jaangarh marotgarh maujgarh dingarh khangarh khairgarh bijnotgarh and islamgarh  with the suffix garh denoting fort these forts are part of the tentative list of unesco world heritage sites and run roughly parallel to the indus and sutlej rivers 40 miles to the south smaller forts in the area include bara bhagla duheinwala falji kandera liara murid machki nawankot and phulra forts the backbone of cholistan economy is animal rearing few other livelihood opportunities aside from livestock farming are available in the region agricultural farming away from the irrigated regions in lower cholistan is difficult due to the lack of steady water supply camels in particular are prized in cholistan for their meat and milk use as transportation and for entertainment such as racing and camel dancing two types of camels are found in cholistan  marrecha or mahra is used for transportation or racingdancing berella is used for milk production and can produce 10–15 liters of milk per day per animal livestock holds much importance for meeting the areas major needs for cottage industry as well as providing milk meat and fat because of the nomadic way of life the main wealth of the people are their cattle that are bred for sale milked or shorn for their wool moreover isolated as they were they had to depend upon themselves for all their needs like food clothing and items of daily use so all their crafts initially stemmed from necessity but later on they started exporting their goods to the other places as well the estimated number of livestock in the desert areas is 16 million cholistan produces a very superior type of carpet wool compared to that produced in other parts of pakistan from this wool they knit beautiful carpets rugs and other woolen items this includes blankets which is also a local necessity for the desert as it is not always dust and heat but winter nights here are very cold too usually below the freezing point khes and pattu are also manufactured with wool or cotton khes is a form of blanket with a field of black white and pattu has a white ground base cholistan is now selling the wool for it brings maximum profit it may be mentioned that cotton textiles have always been a hallmark craft of the indus valley civilization various kinds of khaddarcloth are made for local consumption and fine khaddar bedclothes and coarse lungies are woven here a beautiful cloth called sufi is also woven of silk and cotton or with cotton wrap and silk wool gargas are made with numerous patterns and color having complicated embroidery mirror and patchwork ajrak is another specialty of cholistan it is a special and delicate printing technique on both sides of the cloth in indigo blue and red patterns covering the base cloth cotton turbans and shawls are also made here chunri is another form of dopattas having innumerable colors and patterns like dots squares and circles on it as per the 1998 census of pakistan a total of 128019 people with a 2015 estimate of 229071 with 70 living in lesser cholistan the average household size is 665 as mentioned above the indus valley has always been occupied by the wandering nomadic tribes who are fond of isolated areas as such areas allow them to lead life free of foreign intrusion enabling them to establish their own individual and unique cultures cholistan till the era of mughal rule had also been isolated from outside influence during the rule of mughal emperor akbar it became a proper productive unit the entire area was ruled by a host of kings who securely guarded their frontiers the rulers were the great patrons of art and the various crafts underwent a simultaneous and parallel development influencing each other masons stone carvers artisans artists and designers started rebuilding the old cities and new sites and with that flourished new courts paintings weaving and pottery the fields of architecture sculpture terra cotta and pottery developed greatly in this phase camels are highly valued by the desert dwellers camels are not only useful for transportation and loading purposes but its skin and wool are also quite valuable camel wool is spun and woven into beautiful woolen blankets known as falsies and into stylish and durable rugs the camels leather is also utilized in making caps goblets and expensive lampshades leather work is another important local cottage industry due to the large number of livestock here other than the products mentioned above khusa shoes is a specialty of this area cholistani khusas are very famous for the quality of workmanship variety and richness of designs especially when stitched and embroidered with golden or brightlycolored threads the people of cholistan are fond of jewelry especially gold jewelry the chief ornaments made and worn by them are nath nosegay katmala necklace kangan bracelet and pazeb anklets gold and silver bangles are also a product of cholistan the locals similarly work in enamel producing enamel buttons earrings bangles and rings subsoil water in cholistan is typically brackish and unsuitable for most plant growth native trees shrubs and grasses are drought tolerant there are 131 plant species in cholistan from 89 genera and 24 families \\nmost common of them are below a manmade forest called dingarh was developed by the pakistan council of research in water resources pcrwr on more than 100 ha dunes were fixed and stabilized by mechanical and vegetative means and the area is now covered with trees with orchards of zizyphus date palms and grassland grown with collected rainwater and saline groundwater the wildlife of cholistan desert mostly consists of migratory birds especially the houbara bustard who migrates to this part during winter this species of bird is most famous in the hunting season even though they are endangered in pakistan vulnerable globally according to the iucn red list their population has decreased from 4746 in 2001 to just a few dozens in recent times \\nin december 2016 a qatari prince had his hunting license rejected due to the species being endangered another prince dr fahad was fined with rs 80000 760 and all of the birds he caught were set free for hunting without permit and license\\na few endangered species in this desert are the chinkara antelope great indian bustard and blue bull etc their population of chinkara has decreased from 3000 in 2007 to just a little above 1000 in 2010 due to nonpermit hunting of the species by influential political families the indus civilization was one of the earliest centres of pottery and thus the pottery of cholistan has a long history local soil is very fine and suitable for making pottery the fineness of the earth can be observed on the kacha houses which are actually plastered with mud but look like they have been white washed the chief cholistani ceramic articles are their surahieswhat language is this piyalaswhat language is this and glasses remarkable for their lightness and fine finishing in earlier times only the art of pottery and terracotta developed but from the seventh

tourist attraction drawing up to 250000 visitors a year its history dates back to its discovery by alexanders troops in 320 bc but it started trading in the mughal era the main tunnel at ground level

wpidc took over the administration of salt mines and in 1974 the pakistan mineral development corporation took over the mine which still remains the largest source of salt in the country producing more than 350000 tons per annum of about 99 pure halite estimates of the reserves of salt in the mine vary from 82 million tons to 600 million tons the khewra salt mine is excavated within the base of a thick layer of highly folded faulted and stretched ediacaran to early cambrian evaporites of the salt range formation this geological formation consists of a basal layer of crystalline halite which is intercalated with potash salts this basal layer is overlain by gypsiferous marl which is covered by interlayered beds of gypsum and dolomite with infrequent seams of oil shale these strata are overlain by 200 to 500 meters 660 to 1640\\xa0ft of neoproterozoic to eocene sedimentary rocks that have been uplifted and eroded along with the salt range formation to create the salt range at the southern edge of the pothohar plateau the ediacaran to early cambrian evaporites of the salt range formation have been thrust southward over neoproterozoic to eocene sedimentary rocks by many kilometers which tectonically incorporated fragments of the underlying younger strata within these evaporites the salt range is the southern edge of a welldescribed foldandthrust belt which underlies the entire pothohar plateau and developed south of the himalayas as a result of the ongoing collision between india and eurasia palynomorphs organic microfossils have been used to make inferences about the ages of the salt range formation and its salt layers that are exposed within the khewra salt mine for example while working with geological survey of india in the 1930s and 1940s birbal sahni reported finding evidence of angiosperms gymnosperms and insects inside the mine which he regarded as originating from the eocene period however on the basis of additional geologic data later research has concluded that these palynomorphs were contaminants the khewra salt mine is also known as mayo salt mine in honour of lord mayo who visited it as viceroy of india the salt reserves at khewra were discovered when alexander the great crossed the jhelum and mianwali region during his indian campaign the mine was discovered however not by alexander nor by his allies but by his armys horses when they were found licking the stones ailing horses of his army also recovered after licking the rock salt stones during the mughal era the salt was traded in various markets as far away as central asia on the downfall of the mughal empire the mine was taken over by sikhs hari singh nalwa the sikh commanderinchief shared the management of the salt range with gulab singh the raja of jammu the former controlled the warcha mine while the latter held khewra the salt quarried during sikh rule was both eaten and used as a source of revenuecitation needed in 1872 some time after they had taken over the sikhs territory the british developed the mine further they found the mining to have been inefficient with irregular and narrow tunnels and entrances that made the movement of labourers difficult and dangerous the supply of water inside the mine was poor and there was no storage facility for the mined salt the only road to the mine was over difficult rocky terrain to address these problems the government levelled the road built warehouses provided a water supply improved the entrances and tunnels and introduced a better mechanism for excavation of salt penalties were introduced

decorative items started during the mughal era when many craftsman made tableware and decorations from it warth introduced the use of a lathe to cut out art pieces from the rock salt as he found it similar to gypsum in physical characteristics in 2008 the government of pakistan decided to sell off seventeen profitable organisations including khewra salt mines but the plan was shelved the mine is now operated by the pakistan mineral development corporation a government department khewra salt mine is a major tourist attraction with around 250000 visitors a year earning it considerable revenue visitors are taken into the mine on the khewra salt mines railway there are numerous pools of salty water inside the badshahi masjid was built in the mining tunnels with multicoloured salt bricks about fifty years ago other artistic carvings in the mine include a replica of minarepakistan a statue of allama iqbal an accumulation of crystals that form the name of muhammad in urdu script a model of the great wall of china and another of the mall road of murree in 2003 two phases of development of tourist facilities and attractions were carried out at a total cost of 9 million rupees a clinical ward with 20 beds was established in 2007 costing 10 million rupees for the treatment of asthma and other respiratory diseases using salt therapy the visit pakistan year 2007 event included a train safari visit of khewra salt mine in february 2011 pakistan railways started operating special trains for tourists from lahore and rawalpindi to khewra for this purpose the railway station of khewra was refurbished with the help of a private firm other visitor attractions in the mine include the 75meterhigh 245foothigh assembly hall pulsaraat a salt bridge with no pillars over a 25meterdeep 80footdeep brine pond sheesh mahal palace of mirrors where salt crystals are light pink and a café a mosque has been built inside the salt mines rock salt makes for some beautiful texture on the walls and ceiling it is said that these rooms were mined during the mughal era reflection in salty water at khewra salt mines crystal valley a tunnel with crystals in the wall and roof illuminated by colourful lights artistic work with rock salt copy of minaarepakistan made of rock salt walls made of rock salt the pakistan mineral development corporation established the mine survey institute at khewra in 1971 the institute conducts mine surveys organises miningrelated courses for the miners and has establishes the khewra model high school and the khewra women college more recently the miners won an important environmental case against the mining company for the provision of unpolluted drinking water the water available to the residents of khewra had been polluted by salt coal and other nearby mining activity this case is internationally recognised as important with regard to the relationship between humanity and the environment in 2003 while the government of pakistan was looking for ways to increase the countrys strategic store of oil to 90 days the pmdc put forward a proposal to use the khewra mines to store strategic oil reserves scientific reports confirmed the feasibility of this proposal but it was turned down in 2010 during torrential rain all over pakistan water from a nearby nullah entered the mine reaching a depth of two feet 61\\xa0cm

transboundary river crossing northwestern india and eastern pakistan it is one of five rivers associated with the punjab region under the indus waters treaty of 1960 the waters of the ravi and two other rivers sutlej and beas river were allocated to india subsequently the indus basin project was developed in pakistan which transfers waters from western rivers of the indus system to replenish the portion of the ravi river lying in that country many interbasin water transfers irrigation hydropower and multipurpose projects have been built in india according to ancient history traced to vedas the ravi river was known as irāvatī sanskrit इरावती\\nthe ravi was known as purushni or irawati to indians in vedic times and as hydraotes ancient greek ’ϒδραωτης to the ancient greeks part of the battle of the ten kings was fought on a river which according to yaska nirukta 926 refers to the iravati river raavi river in the punjab the ravi river a transboundary river of india and pakistan is an integral part of the indus river basin and forms the headwaters of the indus basin the waters of the ravi river drain into the arabian sea indian ocean through the indus river in pakistan the river rises in the bara bhangal kangra district in himachal pradesh india the river drains a total catchment area of 14442 square kilometres 5576\\xa0sq\\xa0mi in india after flowing for a length of 720 kilometres 450\\xa0mi flowing westward it is hemmed by the pir panjal and dhauladhar ranges forming a triangular zone the ravi river originates in the himalayas in the multhan tehsil of kangra district of himachal pradesh india it follows a northwesterly course and is a perennial river it is the smallest of the five punjab rivers that rise from glacier fields at an elevation of 14000 feet 4300\\xa0m on the southern side of the mid himalayas it flows through barabhangal bara bansu and chamba districts it flows in rapids in its initial reaches with boulders seen scattered in the bed of the river the ravi river in this reach flows in a gorge with a river bed slope of 183 feet per mile 347\\xa0mkm and is mostly fed by snowmelt as this region lies in a rain shadow two of its major tributaries the budhil and nai or dhona join 64 kilometres 40\\xa0mi downstream from its source the budhil river rises in lahul range of hills and is sourced from the manimahesh kailash peak and the manimahesh lake at an elevation of 4080 metres 13390\\xa0ft and both are hindu pilgrimage sites the entire length of budhil is 72 kilometres 45\\xa0mi where it has a bed slope of 314 feet per mile 595\\xa0mkm it flows through the ancient capital of bharmwar now known as bharmour in himachal pradesh during 1858–1860 the raja of bharmour had considered the budhil valley as an excellent source of deodar trees for supply to the british raj however a part of the forest surrounding the temple was considered sacred and declared a reserved area the second tributary the nai rises at kali debi pass and flows for 48 kilometres 30\\xa0mi with a bed slope of 366 feet per mile 693\\xa0mkm from its source at trilokinath to its confluence with the ravi this valley was also exploited for its forest wealth during the english period another major tributary that joins the ravi river just below bharmour the old capital of chamba is the seul river from the northern direction the valley formed by the river was also exploited for its rich timber trees however the valley has large terraces which are very fertile and known as the garden of chamba crops grown here supply grains to the capital region and to dalhousie town and its surrounding areas one more major tributary that joins the ravi river near basohli jk is the seva this river was also exploited for its forest resources controlled by the then raja of chamba originating from the jammu region the valley is also formed by another major tributary that joins the seul river the bairanalla its subbasin is in the chamba district located above tissa baira drains the southern slopes of the pir panjal range the valley has an elevation variation between 5321 and 2693 metres 17457 and 8835\\xa0ft tant gari is another small tributary that rises from the subsidiary hill ranges of the pir panjal range east of bharmour the valley formed by this stream is ushaped with a river bed scattered with boulders and glacial morainic deposits the main ravi river flows through the base of dalhousie hill past the chamba town it is at an elevation of 856 metres 2807\\xa0ft where a long wooden bridge existed to cross the ravi river it flows into the southwest near dalhousie and then cuts a gorge in the dhauladhar range before entering the punjab plain near madhopur and pathankot it then flows along the indo–pak border for 80 kilometres 50\\xa0mi before entering pakistan and joining the chenab river the total length of the river is about 725 kilometres 450\\xa0mi the ujh river is another major tributary of the ravi river its source is in the kailash mountains at an elevation of 4300 metres 14100\\xa0ft close to the bhaderwah mountains in the jammu district after flowing for 100 kilometres 62\\xa0mi it joins ravi at nainkot in pakistan as the ravi flows past lahore in pakistan 26 kilometres 16\\xa0mi below amritsar in india it is called the river of lahore since that city is on its eastern bank after passing through lahore the river takes a turn at kamalia and then debouches into the chenab river south of the town of ahmadpur sial on its western bank is the town of shahdara bagh with the tomb of jahangir and the tomb of noor jahan according to satellite imagery studies carried out over a period of 20 years between 1972–1973 and 1991–1993 the river coursing along the india–pakistan border meanders substantially in the alluvial plains of the amritsar pathankot and gurdaspur districts of punjab this has resulted in successive damage in india as a result of the river changing its course towards india the reason attributed to this change in the course of the river is massive river training structuresbunds constructed by pakistan in its part of the river close to the old course of the river the shift in the course of the river is reported to be 48 kilometres 30\\xa0mi towards india in the transboundary ravi river flowing from india to pakistan in urban areas of lahore the pollution levels in the river discharge are reportedly very high which is attributed to careless disposal of large amount of industrial and agricultural wastewater and faulty drainage systems in both countries a 72kilometre 45\\xa0mi stretch of the ravi river from lahore siphon to baloki headworks indicates heavy contamination of the water and sediment with cd cr pt and cu the river sediments are highly contaminated and have become a secondary source for pollution of the river water even though some control over unauthorised discharges into the river have been checked hence measures to check metal remobilization from sediments into the river flows need attention the worst affected drainage is the hadharaam drain a tributary of the ravi river it is also a transborder problem involving both india and pakistan a undp funded special programme was launched in 2006 to address the issue in both countries the northern portion surrounding the ravi is the lifeline of many different flora notably deodar walnut holly oak mulberry alder edible pine himalayan cypress chinar daphne papyracea north indian rosewood olive and toxicodendron acuminatum the waters of the ravi river are allocated to india under the indus waters treaty signed by india and pakistan within india the river is under the jurisdiction of the riparian states of punjab and himachal and nonriparian states of haryana jammu  kashmir and rajasthan but the management is presided by the supreme court of india and the ravi beas tribunal set up in 1986 for the purpose the annual flow in india up to the final crossing point in pakistan is 1152\\xa0million acrefeet 1421 cubic kilometres maf out of which 6971 maf is available upstream of madhopur headworks most of the water generated below the madhopur headworks 4549 maf is flowing into pakistan from india on the ravi river the earliest project built was the madhopur headworks in 1902 it is a runofthe river project no storage envisaged to divert flows through the upper bari doab canal also known as central bari doab canal to provide irrigation in the command area of the then unified indiaa government of india has assessed the prepartition use in india punjab at 1821 cubic kilometres 1476000\\xa0acre⋅ft prior to partition it irrigated 335000 hectares of land in gurdaspur amritsar and lahore districts the hydropower potential of the ravi river system has been assessed at 2294 mw of which only 1638 mw has been harnessed cumulatively thus leaving 656 mw wasted opportunity the hydropower potential developed since the 1980s is through the installation of the baira suil hydroelectric power project of 198 mw capacity the chamerai of 540 mw capacity commissioned in 1994 the ranjitsagar multipurpose project of 600 mw capacity completed in 1999 and the chameraii of 300 mw capacity in the upstream of chamerai commissioned in 2004 the major multipurpose project irrigation hydropower flood control development of fisheries tourism and so forth built on the river is the ranjit sagar dam also known as thein dam as it is in thein village the left bank is in punjab and the right bank is in jammu and kashmir it is located on the main stem of the ravi river about 24 kilometres 15\\xa0mi upstream of madhopur headworks built during prepartition time the project is an outcome of the development plan conceived for the use of the waters of three eastern rivers allocated to india under the indus treaty namely the sutlej the beas and the ravi for irrigation hydropower generation and other consumptive uses a proposal for building a storage dam on the ravi river was initially planned in 1912 envisaging a 61 metres 200\\xa0ft high dam a committee later conducted a survey of the area but it was not until 1954 that geologists fully inspected the project area in 1957 a storage dam was proposed on the ravi river for irrigation purposes only the power generation aspect was not considered then it was only in 1964 that the project was conceived for multipurpose development and submitted to government of india for approval finally in april 1982 the project was approved for construction by the government of india the project as built now has a 160metre 520\\xa0ft high earth gravel shell dam with a gross irrigation potential of 348000 hectares 860000 acres of land and power generation of 600 mw 4 units of 150 mw capacity each the geomorpohological setting of the river basin which has a large number of terraces between dhauladhar and pir panjal ranges is attributed to the truly himalayan characteristics of the river reflecting the cishimalayan tectonic structural lithological and climatic conditions obviously it is different from the antecedent indus and sutlej the upper reaches of the main indus river and its tributaries lie in india whereas the lower reaches are in pakistan following the partition of india in august 1947 a dispute arose between india and pakistan on sharing of the waters of the indus river basin the dispute was resolved with the intervention of the world bank and a treaty was signed in 1960 on sharing of the indus waters between india and pakistan the indus system of rivers comprises the three western rivers in the indus the jhelum and chenab together with three eastern rivers the sutlej the beas and the ravi to establish the ownership of these waters indus water treaty was signed between india and pakistan on 1 april 1960 under the monitoring of the world bank the treaty under article 51 envisages the sharing of waters of the rivers ravi beas sutlej jhelum and chenab which join the indus river on its left bank eastern side in pakistan according to this treaty ravi beas and sutlej which constitute the eastern rivers are allocated for exclusive use by india before they enter pakistan however a transition period of 10 years was permitted in which india was bound to supply water to pakistan from these rivers until pakistan was able to build the canal system for utilisation of waters of jhelum chenab and the indus itself allocated to it under the treaty similarly pakistan has exclusive use of the western rivers jhelum chenab and indus but with some stipulations for the development of projects on these rivers in india pakistan also received onetime financial compensation for the loss of water from the eastern rivers since 31 march 1970 after the 10year moratorium india has secured full rights for use of the waters of the three rivers allocated to it the treaty resulted in partitioning of the rivers rather than sharing of their waters under this treaty the two countries also agreed to exchange data and cooperate in matters related to the treaty for this purpose the treaty envisaged the creation of the permanent indus commission with a commissioner appointed by each country the indus waters treaty is the only international treaty that has been implemented over the last 60 years with due diligence and sincerity by both india and pakistan in spite of many wars fought between the two countries the treaty was not revoked either by india or pakistan during the 1965 or the 1971 war even prior to the partition of india in august 1947 india had developed projects on the river ravi and beas river system when the treaty was under debate india had taken advance action to develop the three rivers which were eventually allocated to it under the treaty according to a directive of the government of india planning for the development of the ravi and beas rivers was initiated concurrently with the treaty negotiations which involved four riparian states of punjab pepsu this was merged with punjab and subsequently punjab was divided and additionally the haryana state was created himachal pradesh rajasthan and jammu and kashmir jk within the ambit of the already developed bhakra nangal dam project on the sutlej river a review of the flows in the two river systems revealed that prior to the partition of the country and up to the time of the signing of the indus treaty 386 cubic kilometres 3130000\\xa0acre⋅ft of water was used by major irrigation systems such as the upper bari doab canal system 1959 and the lower bari doab canal system 1915 the unused flow in the two river systems was assessed at 1922 cubic kilometres 15580000\\xa0acre⋅ft which was planned to be developed by the four states of jk pepsu punjab and rajasthan however with the merger of pepsu with punjab and subsequent bifurcation of punjab into two states a dispute arose on the allocation of ravi and beas waters for which a tribunal was set up under the interstate river water disputes act as a counterclaim to the exclusive claims of punjab haryana claims that a small part of haryana state lying north in panchkula district is part of the sutlej river basin area in addition to punjab and himachal pradesh in india thus haryana claims to be a riparian state of the indus river basin following the reorganisation of the state of punjab in 1966 haryana state was created this was followed by a notification by the government of india dated 24 march 1976 allocating the surplus waters between punjab and haryana in due consideration of the powers conferred by sub section i of section 78 of the punjab reorganization act 1966 31 of 1966 the allocation was challenged in the supreme court by haryana a tripartite agreement followed on 31 december 1981 based on the revised mean annual flows from the flow series of 1921–60 assessed as 2536 cubic kilometres 20560000\\xa0acre⋅ft—including preparation use of 386 cubic kilometres 3130000\\xa0acre⋅ft and transit losses in the madhopur beas link of 260000 acrefeet 032\\xa0km3—visavis the figure of 1955 cubic kilometres 15850000\\xa0acre⋅ft assessed in earlier allocation which was based on the flow series of 1921–45 the revised assessed surplus supplies of 17170000 acrefeet 2118\\xa0km3 from flow and storage was allocated as share of punjab 422\\xa0million\\xa0acreft maf share of haryana 350 maf share of rajasthan 860 maf quantity earmarked for delhi water supply 020 maf share of jammu  kashmir 065maf with some specific provisions however the legality of this agreement was challenged by punjab this was followed by the punjab accord signed by the then prime minister of india rajiv gandhi and sant harchand singh longowal president of the shiromani akali dal on 24 july 1985 this accord stipulated that the farmers of punjab haryana and rajasthan will continue to get water not less than what they are using from the ravi beas system as on 171985 waters used for consumptive purposes will also remain unaffected quantum of usage claimed shall be verified by the tribunal referred to in paragraph 92 below 92 the claim of punjab and haryana regarding the shares in their remaining waters shall be referred for adjudication to a tribunal to be presided over by supreme court judge the decision of this tribunal will be rendered within six months and would be binding on both parties all legal and constitutional steps in this respect to be taken expeditiously 93 the construction of sutlej yamuna link syl canal shall continue the canal shall be completed by august 1986 following the above accord ravi  beas waters tribunal rbwt came to be set up in april 1986 in pursuance of paragraphs 91  92 of punjab settlement rajivlongowal accord 1985 interalia to adjudicate the claims of punjab and haryana in ravibeas waters the terms of reference were set and also the time for submission of the report the tribunal submitted its report on 30 january 1987 however the report was contested as rajasthan also moved an application seeking explanation and guidance regarding the report of this ravi beas waters tribunal 1987 the tribunal is further examining the matter it is yet to submit its further report to the government on the pleas submitted by the party states and the central government also seeking explanationguidance on its earlier report in the meantime a presidential reference on punjab termination of agreements act 2004 is pending before the honorable supreme court hence the further hearings of the tribunal and its final report are now enjoined on the outcome of the supreme court hearing of the presidential reference the presently incomplete syl link canal to connect the sutlej and yamuna rivers to transfer haryanas share of water is now stuck in a dispute in the supreme court of india due to objections by punjab punjab is contemplating to construct 206 mw shahpurkandi dam project hydro electric project on the ravi river between ranjitsagar dam and madhopur head works this stretch of the river is forming boundary between j  k state and punjab state since punjab had unilaterally exited from the earlier water sharing agreements j  k state refused the project construction also j  k state is going ahead with the construction of ravi canal originating from basantpur to irrigate 54000 hectares 133000 acres of land in jammu region this canal would draw river water by pumping the water released downstream from the rangitsagar reservoir for which j  k state is not required to take consent from punjab as it is not bound by earlier river water sharing agreements transfer of surplus water from one basin to another termed as interbasin water transfer has been effectively implemented on the ravi river the surplus waters of the ravi river have been transferred directly first to the beas river through the ravibeas link a further link from the beas river to the sutlej river by the beas sutlej link augments storage of the bhakra reservoir in india

rivers in the world in terms of average annual flow its leftbank tributary in ladakh is the zanskar river and its leftbank tributary in the plains is the panjnad river which is formed by the successive confluences of the five punjab rivers namely the chenab jhelum ravi beas and sutlej rivers its principal rightbank tributaries are the shyok gilgit kabul kurram and gomal rivers beginning in a mountain spring and fed with glaciers and rivers in the himalayan karakoram and hindu kush ranges the river supports the ecosystems of temperate forests plains and arid countryside the northern part of the indus valley with its tributaries forms the punjab region of south asia while the lower course of the river ends in a large delta in the southern sindh province of pakistan the river has historically been important to many cultures of the region the 3rd millennium bce saw the rise of indus valley civilisation a major urban civilization of the bronze age during the 2nd millennium bce the punjab region was mentioned in the rigveda hymns as sapta sindhu and in the avesta religious texts as saptha hindu both terms meaning seven rivers early historical kingdoms that arose in the indus valley include gandhāra and the ror dynasty of sauvīra the indus river came into the knowledge of the western world early in the classical period when king darius of persia sent his greek subject scylax of caryanda to explore the river c\\u2009515\\xa0bce this river was known to the ancient indians in sanskrit as sindhu and the persians as hindu which was regarded by both of them as the border river the variation between the two names is explained by the old iranian sound change s  h which occurred between 850 and 600 bce according to asko parpola from the persian achaemenid empire the name passed to the greeks as indós ἰνδός it was adopted by the romans as indus the name india is derived from indus the ladakhis and tibetans call the river senge tsangpo སེང་གེ་གཙང་པོ། baltis call it gemtsuh and tsuhfo pashtuns call it nilab sher darya and abbasin while sindhis call it mehran purali and samundar the modern name in urdu and hindi is sindh urdu سِنْدھ hindi सिंध a semilearned borrowing from sanskrit the indus river provides key water resources for pakistans economy – especially the breadbasket of punjab province which accounts for most of the nations agricultural production and sindh the word punjab means land of five rivers and the five rivers are jhelum chenab ravi beas and sutlej all of which finally flow into the indus the indus also supports many heavy industries and provides the main supply of potable water in pakistan the total length of the river varies in different sources the length used in this article is 3180\\xa0km 1980\\xa0mi taken from the himalayan climate and water atlas 2015 historically the 1909 the imperial gazetteer of india gave it as just over 1800 miles a shorter figure of 2880\\xa0km 1790\\xa0mi has been widely used in modern sources as has the one of 3180\\xa0km 1980\\xa0mi the modern encyclopedia britannica was originally published in 1999 with the shorter measurement but was updated in 2015 to use the longer measurement both lengths are commonly found in modern publications in some cases both measurements can be found within the same work an extended figure of circa 3600\\xa0km 2200\\xa0mi was announced by a chinese research group in 2011 based on a comprehensive remeasurement from satellite imagery and a ground expedition to identify an alternative source point but detailed analysis has not yet been published the ultimate source of the indus is in tibet but there is some debate about the exact source the traditional source of the river is the sênggê kanbab sênggê zangbo or lions mouth a perennial spring not far from the sacred mount kailash marked by a long low line of tibetan chortens there are several other tributaries nearby which may possibly form a longer stream than sênggê kanbab but unlike the sênggê kanbab are all dependent on snowmelt the zanskar river which flows into the indus in ladakh has a greater volume of water than the indus itself before that point an alternative reckoning begins the river around 300\\xa0km further upstream at the confluence of the sengge zangbo and gar tsangpo rivers which drain the nganglong kangri and gangdise shan gang rinpoche mt kailash mountain ranges the 2011 remeasurement suggested the source was a small lake northeast of mount kailash rather than either of the two points previously used the indus then flows northwest through ladakh indianadministered kashmir and baltistan and gilgit pakistanadministered kashmir just south of the karakoram range the shyok shigar and gilgit rivers carry glacial waters into the main river it gradually bends to the south and descends into the punjab plains at kalabagh pakistan the indus passes gigantic gorges 4500–5200 metres 15000–17000\\xa0ft deep near the nanga parbat massif it flows swiftly across hazara and is dammed at the tarbela reservoir the kabul river joins it near attock the remainder of its route to the sea is in the plains of the punjab and sindh where the flow of the river becomes slow and highly braided it is joined by the panjnad at mithankot beyond this confluence the river at one time was named the satnad river sat  seven nadī  river as the river now carried the waters of the kabul river the indus river and the five punjab rivers passing by jamshoro it ends in a large delta to the south of thatta in the sindh province of pakistan the indus is one of the few rivers in the world to exhibit a tidal bore the indus system is largely fed by the snow and glaciers of the himalayas karakoram and the hindu kush ranges the flow of the river is also determined by the seasons – it diminishes greatly in the winter while flooding its banks in the monsoon months from july to september there is also evidence of a steady shift in the course of the river since prehistoric times – it deviated westwards from flowing into the rann of kutch and adjoining banni grasslands after the 1816 earthquake as of 2011update indus water flows in to the rann of kutch during its floods breaching flood banks the major cities of the indus valley civilisation such as harappa and mohenjodaro date back to around 3300\\xa0bce and represent some of the largest human habitations of the ancient world the indus valley civilisation extended from across northeast afghanistan to pakistan and northwest india with an upward reach from east of jhelum river to ropar on the upper sutlej the coastal settlements extended from sutkagan dor at the pakistan iran border to kutch in modern gujarat india there is an indus site on the amu darya at shortughai in northern afghanistan and the indus site alamgirpur at the hindon river is located only 28\\xa0km 17\\xa0mi from delhi to date over 1052 cities and settlements have been found mainly in the general region of the ghaggarhakra river and its tributaries among the settlements were the major urban centres of harappa and mohenjodaro as well as lothal dholavira ganeriwala and rakhigarhi only 40 indus valley sites have been discovered on the indus and its tributaries however it is notable that majority of the indus script seals and inscribed objects discovered were found at sites along the indus rivera most scholars believe that settlements of gandhara grave culture of the early indoaryans flourished in gandhara from 1700\\xa0bce to 600\\xa0bce when mohenjodaro and harappa had already been abandoned the rigveda describes several rivers including one named sindhu the rigvedic sindhu is thought to be the presentday indus river it is attested 176 times in its text 94 times in the plural and most often used in the generic sense of river in the rigveda notably in the later hymns the meaning of the word is narrowed to refer to the indus river in particular eg in the list of rivers mentioned in the hymn of nadistuti sukta the rigvedic hymns apply a feminine gender to all the rivers mentioned therein except for the brahmaputra the word india is derived from the indus river in ancient times india initially referred to those regions immediately along the east bank of the indus where are punjab and sindh now but by 300\\xa0bce greek writers including herodotus and megasthenes were applying the term to the entire subcontinent that extends much farther eastward the lower basin of the indus forms a natural boundary between the iranian plateau and the indian subcontinent this region embraces all or parts of the pakistani provinces balochistan khyber pakhtunkhwa punjab and sindh and the countries afghanistan and india the first west eurasian empire to annex the indus valley was the persian empire during the reign of darius the great during his reign the greek explorer scylax of caryanda was commissioned to explore the course of the indus it was crossed by the invading armies of alexander but after his macedonians conquered the west bank—joining it to the hellenic world they elected to retreat along the southern course of the river ending alexanders asian campaign alexanders admiral nearchus set out from the indus delta to explore the persian gulf until reaching the tigris river the indus valley was later dominated by the mauryan and kushan empires indogreek kingdoms indoscythians and hepthalites over several centuries muslim armies of muhammad ibn alqasim mahmud of ghazni muhammad of ghor timur and babur crossed the river to invade sindh and punjab providing a gateway to the indian subcontinent indus is an antecedent river meaning that it existed before the himalayas and entrenched itself while they were rising the indus river feeds the indus submarine fan which is the second largest sediment body on earth it consists of around 5\\xa0million cubic kilometres of material eroded from the mountains studies of the sediment in the modern river indicate that the karakoram mountains in northern pakistan and india are the single most important source of material with the himalayas providing the next largest contribution mostly via the large rivers of the punjab jhelum ravi chenab beas and sutlej analysis of sediments from the arabian sea has demonstrated that prior to five million years ago the indus was not connected to these punjab rivers which instead flowed east into the ganga and were captured after that time earlier work showed that sand and silt from western tibet was reaching the arabian sea by 45\\xa0million years ago implying the existence of an ancient indus river by that time the delta of this protoindus river has subsequently been found in the katawaz basin on the afghanpakistan border in the nanga parbat region the massive amounts of erosion due to the indus river following the capture and rerouting through that area is thought to bring middle and lower crustal rocks to the surface in november 2011 satellite images showed that the indus river had reentered india feeding great rann of kutch little rann of kutch and a lake near ahmedabad known as nal sarovar heavy rains had left the river basin along with the lake manchar lake hemal and kalri lake all in modernday pakistan inundated this happened two centuries after the indus river shifted its course westwards following the 1819 rann of kutch earthquake the induan age at start of the triassic period of geological time is named for the indus region accounts of the indus valley from the times of alexanders campaign indicate a healthy forest cover in the region the mughal emperor babur writes of encountering rhinoceroses along its bank in his memoirs the baburnama extensive deforestation and human interference in the ecology of the shivalik hills has led to a marked deterioration in vegetation and growing conditions the indus valley regions are arid with poor vegetation agriculture is sustained largely due to irrigation works\\nthe indus river and its watershed has a rich biodiversity it is home to around 25 amphibian species the indus river dolphin platanista indicus minor is found only in the indus river it is a subspecies of the south asian river dolphin the indus river dolphin formerly also occurred in the tributaries of the indus river according to the world wildlife fund it is one of the most threatened cetaceans with only about 1816 still existing it is threatened by habitat degradation from the construction of dams and canals entanglement in fishing gear and industrial water pollution there are two otter species in the indus river basin the eurasian otter in the northeastern highland sections and the smoothcoated otter elsewhere in the river basin the smoothcoated otters in the indus river represent a subspecies found nowhere else the sindh otter lutrogale perspicillata sindica the indus river basin has a high diversity being the home of more than 180 freshwater fish species including 22 which are found nowhere else fish also played a major role in earlier cultures of the region including the ancient indus valley civilisation where depictions of fish were frequent the indus script has a commonly used fish sign which in its various forms may simply have meant fish or referred to stars or gods in the uppermost highest part of the indus river basin there are relatively few genera and species diptychus ptychobarbus schizopyge schizopygopsis and schizothorax snowtrout triplophysa loaches and the catfish glyptosternon reticulatum going downstream these are soon joined by the golden mahseer tor putitora alternatively t macrolepis although it often is regarded as a synonym of t putitora and schistura loaches downriver from around thakot tarbela the kabul–indus river confluence attock khurd and peshawar the diversity rises strongly including many cyprinids amblypharyngodon aspidoparia barilius chela cirrhinus crossocheilus cyprinion danio devario esomus garra labeo naziritor osteobrama pethia puntius rasbora salmophasia securicula and systomus true loaches botia and lepidocephalus stone loaches acanthocobitis and nemacheilus ailiid catfish clupisoma bagridae catfish batasio mystus rita and sperata airsac catfish heteropneustes schilbid catfish eutropiichthys silurid catfish ompok and wallago sisorid catfish bagarius gagata glyptothorax and sisor gouramis trichogaster nandid leaffish nandus snakeheads channa spiny eel macrognathus and mastacembelus knifefish notopterus glassfish chanda and parambassis clupeids gudusia needlefish xenentodon and gobies glossogobius as well as a few introduced species as the altitude further declines the indus basin becomes overall quite slowflowing as it passes through the punjab plain major carp become common and chameleonfish badis mullet sicamugil and swamp eel monopterus appear in some upland lakes and tributaries of the punjab region snowtrout and mahseer are still common but once the indus basin reaches its lower plain the former group is entirely absent and the latter are rare many of the species of the middle sections of the indus basin are also present in the lower notable examples of genera that are present in the lower plain but generally not elsewhere in the indus river basin are the aphanius pupfish aplocheilus killifish palla fish tenualosa ilisha catla labeo catla rohu labeo rohita and cirrhinus mrigala the lowermost part of the river and its delta are home to freshwater fish but also a number of brackish and marine species this includes pomfret and prawns the large delta has been recognized by conservationists as an important ecological region here the river turns into many marshes streams and creeks and meets the sea at shallow levels palla fish tenualosa ilisha of the river is a delicacy for people living along the river the population of fish in the river is moderately high with sukkur thatta and kotri being the major fishing centres – all in the lower sindh course as a result damming and irrigation has made fish farming an important economic activity the indus is the most important supplier of water resources to the punjab and sindh plains – it forms the backbone of agriculture and food production in pakistan the river is especially critical since rainfall is meagre in the lower indus valley irrigation canals were first built by the people of the indus valley civilisation and later by the engineers of the kushan empire and the mughal empire modern irrigation was introduced by the british east india company in 1850 – the construction of modern canals accompanied with the restoration of old canals the british supervised the construction of one of the most complex irrigation networks in the world the guddu barrage is 1350\\xa0m 4430\\xa0ft long – irrigating sukkur jacobabad larkana and kalat the sukkur barrage serves over 20000\\xa0km2 7700\\xa0sq\\xa0mi after pakistan came into existence a water control treaty signed between india and pakistan in 1960 guaranteed that pakistan would receive water from the indus river and its two tributaries the jhelum river and the chenab river independently of upstream control by india the indus basin project consisted primarily of the construction of two main dams the mangla dam built on the jhelum river and the tarbela dam constructed on the indus river together with their subsidiary dams the pakistan water and power development authority undertook the construction of the chashmajhelum link canal – linking the waters of the indus and jhelum rivers – extending water supplies to the regions of bahawalpur and multan pakistan constructed the tarbela dam near rawalpindi – standing 2743 metres 9000\\xa0ft long and 143 metres 470\\xa0ft high with an 80kilometre 50\\xa0mi long reservoir it supports the chashma barrage near dera ismail khan for irrigation use and flood control and the taunsa barrage near dera ghazi khan which also produces 100000\\xa0kilowatts of electricity the kotri barrage near hyderabad is 915 metres 3000\\xa0ft long and provides additional water supplies for karachi the extensive linking of tributaries with the indus has helped spread water resources to the valley of peshawar in the khyber pakhtunkhwa the extensive irrigation and dam projects provide the basis for pakistans large production of crops such as cotton sugarcane and wheat the dams also generate electricity for heavy industries and urban centres the indus river is sacred to hindus the sindhu darshan festival is held on every guru purnima on the banks of the indus the ethnicities of the indus valley pakistan and northwest india have a greater amount of ani or west eurasian admixture than other south asians including inputs from western steppe herders with evidence of more sustained and multilayered migrations from the west originally the delta used to receive almost all of the water from the indus river which has an annual flow of approximately 180\\xa0billion cubic metres 240×109\\xa0cu\\xa0yd and is accompanied by 400\\xa0million tonnes 390×106 long tons of silt since the 1940s dams barrages and irrigation works have been constructed on the river the indus basin irrigation system is the largest contiguous irrigation system developed over the past 140 years anywhere in the world this has reduced the flow of water and by 2018 the average annual flow of water below the kotri barrage was 33\\xa0billion cubic metres 43×109\\xa0cu\\xa0yd and annual amount of silt discharged was estimated at 100\\xa0million tonnes 98×106 long tonscitation needed as a result the 2010 pakistan floods were considered good news for the ecosystem and population of the river delta as they brought much needed fresh water any further utilization of the river basin water is not economically feasible vegetation and wildlife of the indus delta are threatened by the reduced inflow of fresh water along with extensive deforestation industrial pollution and global warming damming has also isolated the delta population of indus river dolphins from those further upstream largescale diversion of the rivers water for irrigation has raised farreaching issues sediment clogging from poor maintenance of canals has affected agricultural production and vegetation on numerous occasions irrigation itself is increasing soil salinization reducing crop yields and in some cases rendering farmland useless for cultivation the tibetan plateau contains the worlds thirdlargest store of ice qin dahe the former head of the china meteorological administration said the recent fast pace of melting and warmer temperatures will be good for agriculture and tourism in the short term but issued a strong warning temperatures are rising four times faster than elsewhere in china and the tibetan glaciers are retreating at a higher speed than in any other part of the world in the short term this will cause lakes to expand and bring floods and mudflows in the long run the glaciers are vital lifelines of the indus river once they vanish water supplies in pakistan will be in peril there is insufficient data to say what will happen to the indus says david grey the world banks senior water advisor in south asia but we all have very nasty fears that the flows of the indus could be severely severely affected by glacier melt as a consequence of climate change and reduced by perhaps as much as 50 per cent now what does that mean to a population that lives in a desert where without the river there would be no life i dont know the answer to that question he says but we need to be concerned about that deeply deeply concerned us diplomat richard holbrooke said shortly before his death in 2010 that he believed that falling water levels in the indus river could very well precipitate world war iii over the years factories on the banks of the indus river have increased levels of water pollution in the river and the atmosphere around it high levels of pollutants in the river have led to the deaths of endangered indus river dolphin the sindh environmental protection agency has ordered polluting factories around the river to shut down under the pakistan environmental protection act 1997 death of the indus river dolphin has also been attributed to fishermen using poison to kill fish and scooping them up as a result the government banned fishing from guddu barrage to sukkur the indus is second among a group of ten rivers responsible for about 90 of all the plastic that reaches the oceans the yangtze is the only river contributing more plastic frequently indus river is prone to moderate to severe flooding in july 2010 following abnormally heavy monsoon rains the indus river rose above its banks and started flooding the rain continued for the next two months devastating large areas of pakistan in sindh the indus burst its banks near sukkur on 8 august submerging the village of mor khan jatoi in early august the heaviest flooding moved southward along the indus river from severely affected northern regions toward western punjab where at least 1400000 acres 570000\\xa0ha of cropland was destroyed and the southern province of sindh as of september 2010update over two thousand people had died and over a million homes had been destroyed since the flooding began the 2011 sindh floods began during the pakistani monsoon season in midaugust 2011 resulting from heavy monsoon rains in sindh eastern balochistan and southern punjab the floods caused considerable damage an estimated 434 civilians were killed with 53\\xa0million people and 1524773 homes affected sindh is a fertile region and often called the breadbasket of the country the damage and toll of the floods on the local agrarian economy was said to be extensive at least 17\\xa0million acres 690000\\xa0ha 2700\\xa0sq\\xa0mi of arable land were inundated the flooding followed the previous years floods which devastated a large part of the country unprecedented torrential monsoon rains caused severe flooding in 16 districts of sindh in pakistan currently there are six barrages on the indus guddu barrage sukkur barrage kotri barrage also called ghulam muhammad barrage taunsa barrage chashma barrage and jinnah barrage another new barrage called sindh barrage is planned as a terminal barrage on the indus river there are some bridges on river indus such as dadu moro bridge larkana khairpur indus river bridge thattasujawal bridge jhirkmula katiar bridge and recently planned kandhkotghotki bridge the entire left bank of indus river in sind province is protected from river flooding by constructing around 600\\xa0km long levees the right bank side is also leveed from guddu barrage to lake manchar in response to the levees construction the river has been aggrading rapidly over the last 20 years leading to breaches upstream of barrages and inundation of large areas tarbela dam in pakistan is constructed on the indus river while the controversial kalabagh dam is also being constructed on indus river pakistan is also building munda dam video of river indus at kotri barrage sindh pakistan lansdowne bridge and ayub bridge connecting

the chenab rivera is a major river that flows in india and pakistan and is one of the 5 major rivers of the punjab region it is formed by the union of two headwaters chandra and bhaga which rise in the upper himalayas in the lahaul region of himachal pradesh india the chenab flows through the jammu region of jammu and kashmir india into the plains of punjab pakistan before ultimately flowing into the indus river the waters of the chenab were allocated to pakistan under the terms of the indus waters treaty india is allowed nonconsumptive uses such as power generation the chenab river is extensively used in pakistan for irrigation its waters are also transferred to the channel of the ravi river via numerous link canals the chenab river was called asikni sanskrit असिक्नी in the rigveda viii2025 x755 the name meant that it was seen to have darkcoloured waters the term krishana is also found in the atharvaveda a later form of askikni was iskamati sanskrit इस्कामतिcitation needed and the greek form was ancient greek ἀκεσίνης  akesínes latinized to acesines in the mahabharata the common name of the river was chandrabhaga sanskrit चन्द्रभागा because the river is formed from the confluence of the chandra and the bhaga rivers this name was also known to the ancient greeks who hellenised it in various forms such as sandrophagos sandabaga and cantabra the simplification of chandrabhaga to chenab with evident persianate influence probably occurred in early medieval times and is witnessed in alberuni the river is formed by the confluence of two rivers chandra and bhaga at tandi 8\\xa0km 50\\xa0mi southwest of keylong in the lahaul and spiti district of the indian state of himachal pradesh the bhaga river originates from surya taal lake which is situated a few kilometers west of the baralacha la pass in himachal pradesh the chandra river originates from glaciers east of the same pass near chandra taal this pass also acts as a waterdivide between these two rivers the chandra river transverses 115\\xa0km 71\\xa0mi while the bhaga river transverses 60\\xa0km 37\\xa0mi through narrow gorges before their confluence at tandi the chandrabhaga then flows through the chamba district in himachal pradesh before entering the jammu division of jammu and kashmir where it flows through the kishtwar doda ramban reasi and jammu districts it enters pakistan and flows through the punjab province before emptying into the sutlej forming the panjnad river the river was known to indians in the vedic period in 325 bce alexander the great allegedly founded the town of alexandria on the indus presentday uch sharif or mithankot or chacharan in pakistan at the confluence of the indus and the combined streams of punjab rivers currently known as the panjnad river arrian in the anabasis of alexander quotes the eyewitness ptolemy lagides as writing that the river is 2 miles wide where alexander crossed it the river has rich power generation potential in india there are many dams built under construction or proposed to be built on the chenab for the purpose of hydroelectric power generation in the country including all of these are runoftheriver projects as per the indus water treaty of 1960 the treaty allocates the waters of chenab to pakistan india can use its water for domestic and agricultural uses or for nonconsumptive uses such as hydropower india is entitled to store up to 12\\xa0million acrefeet 15\\xa0billion cubic metres of water in its projects the three projects completed as of 2011update salal baglihar and dul hasti have a combined storage capacity of 260\\xa0thousand acrefeet 320\\xa0million cubic metres pakistan has four headworks on the chenab torkham border crossing urdu persian and pashto تورخم tūrkham is a major border crossing between the pakistani city of torkham and afghanistan located along the grand trunk road on the international border between the two countries it connects nangarhar province of afghanistan with pakistans khyber pakhtunkhwa province it is the busiest port of entry between the two countries serving as a major transporting shipping and receiving site highway 7 connects torkham to kabul through jalalabad on the pakistani side the border crossing is at the end of the n5 national highway which connects it to peshawar in the east via the khyber pass and further connects it to islamabad by other routes the afghan border police and pakistans frontier corps are the main agencies for controlling torkham they are backed by the pakistani and afghan armed forces torkham belongs to the momand dara district of nangarhar on 15 august 2021 torkham was seized by taliban fighters becoming the second border crossing with pakistan to be captured by taliban as part of wider 2021 taliban offensive as a response pakistan temporarily closed the border crossing the location has been used throughout history by afghan and turkic caravans including marching armies of powerful empires most of these were on their way to northern india passing through peshawar and then lahore some of the well known regional historical figures who are believed to have passed through torkham are chandragupta maurya hsüantsang jayapala albiruni ibn battuta babur humayun nader shah ahmad shah durrani zaman shah durrani dost mohammad khan and akbar khan over much of the last century there have been proposals to extend the defunct khyber rail service to afghanistan and possibly beyond passing through jalalabad in 2010 pakistan and afghanistan signed a memorandum of understanding mou for going ahead with the laying of rail tracks between the two countries work on the proposed project was supposed to start in 2010 in november 2001 the new york times reported that torkham is hajji alis hometown ali was an antitaliban militia leader who seized power after the taliban retreated it was reported that hajji ali had joined forces with two other militia leaders mawlawi yunis khalis and ezatullah to set up a regional provisional government on the pakistani side torkham lies at the end of the n5 national highway it is connected to city of peshawar in the east transported goods arrive to torkham from the port city of karachi in sindh province torkham is 5 kilometres 31\\xa0mi west of the summit of the khyber pass it lies on the most important supply route for usled nato forces in afghanistan pakistans government sometimes block supplies due to the american use of drone strikes in pakistan in april 2006 the afghan border police began requiring travelers crossing the border at torkham to possess valid travel documents pakistan has completed the construction of border gate crossing terminal and other associated infrastructure on its side of torkham border by july 2016 border gate has been named as babipakistan and  the crossing terminal has been named shaheed major ali jawad changezi terminal after the officer lost his life in skirmishes against the afghan security forces at the same border and in the clashes that resulted from the construction of this very gate the flag hosting ceremony has also started just like the one at wagah border crossing with india now no one will be allowed to cross border without proper documentations to check the infiltration of terrorists from afghanistan into pakistan work on the construction of the gate and associated facilities began in 2014 but kept getting delayed because of afghan reservations and abrupt clashes pakistan plans to have similar border control measures at all six major crossing points between the two

is a visafree border crossing and religious corridor connecting the gurdwara darbar sahib near lahore in pakistan to gurudwara dera baba nanak gurdaspur district punjab india the crossing allows devotees from india to visit the gurdwara in kartarpur pakistan 47 kilometres 29 miles from the india–pakistan border on the pakistani side without a visa however pakistani sikhs are unable to use the border crossing and cannot access dera baba nanak on the indian side without first obtaining an indian visa or unless they work there the kartarpur corridor was first proposed in early 1999 by atal bihari vajpayee and nawaz sharif the prime ministers of india and pakistan respectively at that time as part of the delhi–lahore bus diplomacy on 26 november 2018 the foundation stone was laid down on the indian side by prime minister narendra modi two days later then pakistani prime minister imran khan did the same for the pakistani side the corridor was completed for the 550th anniversary of the birth of guru nanak on 12 november 2019 khan said pakistan believes that the road to prosperity of region sic and bright future of our coming generation lies in peace adding that pakistan is not only opening the border but also their hearts for the sikh community indian prime minister narendra modi compared the decision by the two countries to go ahead with the corridor to the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 saying that the project could help in easing tensions between the two countries previously sikh pilgrims from india had to take a bus to lahore to get to kartarpur which is a 125 kilometres 78 miles journey even though people on the indian side of the border could also physically see gurdwara darbar sahib kartarpur from the indian side where an elevated observation platform was constructed on 17 november 2021 the kartarpur corridor reopened after over a year and a half of closure due to the covid19 pandemic both india and pakistan have allowed citizens to visit the gurdwara on the condition that they carry both a negative covid19 test and are fully vaccinated the first guru of sikhism guru nanak founded kartarpur in 1504\\xa0ce on the right bank of the ravi river and established the first sikh commune there following his death in 1539 hindus and muslims both claimed him as their own and raised mausoleums in his memory with a common wall between them the changing course of the ravi river eventually washed away the mausoleums a new habitation was formed representing the presentday dera baba nanak on the left bank of the ravi river after the 1947 partition of india the region was divided between india and pakistan the radcliffe line awarded the shakargarh tehsil on the right bank of the ravi river including kartarpur to pakistan and the gurdaspur tehsil on the left bank of ravi to india in 1948 the akali dal demanded that india should acquire the land of the gurdwaras in nankana sahib and kartarpur the demands persisted till 1959 but the punjab state government controlled by the indian national congress advised against any modification of the boundary fixed by the radcliffe award for many years following partition indian sikhs could visit kartarpur informally by crossing the jassar bridge 32°02′57″n 74°59′33″e\\ufeff  \\ufeff3204923°n 7499242°e\\ufeff  3204923 7499242 on the ravi river as border controls between the two countries were not strictly enforced until 1965 the bridge was destroyed by pakistani forces during the indopakistan war of 1965 to inhibit potential indian advances and border controls became more tightly regulated in 1969 on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of the birth of guru nanak prime minister indira gandhi promised to approach the pakistani government for a landswap so that kartarpur sahib could become part of india however none of this materialised in september 1974 a protocol was agreed between india and pakistan for visits to religious shrines around 2005 the protocol was updated by increasing the number of visits and the number of sites however kartarpur was not among the sites included in the 1974\\xa0protocol according to the indian ministry of external affairs india had requested its inclusion but this was not agreed to by pakistan gobind singh the caretaker of the gurdwara at kartarpur said the gurdwara had remained shut from 1947 to 2000 the gurdwara had no staff despite receiving pilgrims and entrance was restricted the pakistani government started repairing the shrine in september 2000 ahead of the anniversary of guru nanaks death and formally reopened it in september 2004 the kartarpur corridor mission was initially started by bhabishan singh goraya who pursued the cause for 24 years according to akali leader kuldeep singh wadala the gurdwara had been abandoned till 2003 it served as a cattle shed for the villagers and its lands were taken over by sharecroppers since 2003 however the pakistani government has reportedly taken initiatives for the upkeep of sikh religious shrines during the tenure of prime ministers nawaz sharif and atal bihari vajpayee the opening of kartarpur border crossing was first discussed in 1998 after further discussions during the 1999 bus diplomacy pakistan renovated the kartarpur sahib gurdwara and made it available for viewing from the indian border the tensions arising from the kargil war had effectively destroyed india–pakistan relations however it was reported that general pervez musharraf gave a green signal for constructing a corridor according to the pakistan gurdwara prabandhak committee chairman ltgen javed nasir manmohan singh during his first\\xa0term as the prime minister of india also tabled the issue in a speech in punjab in 2004 the composite dialogue process between india and pakistan initiated in 2004 also discussed access to kartarpur via an amritsar–lahore–kartarpur road link in 2008 the indian foreign minister pranab mukherjee raised with his pakistani counterpart shah mehmood qureshi the idea of visafree travel to kartarpur there was apparently no official response but privately pakistan began to express its openness to the sikh community however even up to 2012 the indian government had no response the hostility between the countries was apparently to blame on 20 june 2008 at a press conference in dera baba nanak arranged by akali leader kuldeep singh wadala john w mcdonald a former american ambassador and founder of institute for multitrack diplomacy called for a peace corridor a peace zone connecting shrines on both sides of the border on 28 june 2008 the indian foreign minister at the time pranab mukherjee said that the indian government would carry out a feasibility study for the peace corridor however since the 2008 mumbai attacks took place the relations between india and pakistan nosedived and the initiative faltered members of the sikh community in washington dc worked with the institute for multitrack diplomacy to carry out an independent feasibility study in august 2010 their report titled kartarpur marg was released by surinder singh and the institute according to the report the cost of the corridor would be 17 million us dollars which the sikh diaspora agreed to raise the report had said that it would cost pakistan 148 million and india 22 million in november 2010 the punjab state legislative assembly unanimously passed a resolution in favour of an international passage between the two sites and forwarded it to the indian union government on 1 october 2010 in august 2018 the then indian punjab tourism minister navjot singh sidhu attended the pakistani prime minister imran khans inaugural ceremony where he was told by the pakistan army chief qamar javed bajwa of pakistans willingness to open the dera baba nanak–kartarpur corridor on guru nanaks 550th\\xa0birth anniversary given the clear time frame this set the ball rolling in august 2018 another resolution related to the corridor in the indian punjab vidhan sabha was moved by then chief minister amarinder singh which was passed unanimously following this the government of indian punjab decided to approach the prime minister of india related to the opening of the corridor on 30 october 2018 a group of sikh americans sought the indian prime ministers help in opening the corridor in november 2018 the indian cabinet approved the plan to set up the corridor and appealed to pakistan to do the same the pakistani foreign minister s m qureshi responded by tweeting that pakistan had already conveyed to india that it would open a corridor in august 2019 india and pakistan agreed to allow visafree travel of indian citizens to kartarpur but differences persisted about indian consular officers being located at the site on 24 october 2019 scl das joint secretary internal security in the union home ministry from india and pakistan foreign office director general south asia and saarc mohammad faisal met at zero point near dera baba nanak in the border town of gurdaspur to ink the memorandum of understanding the signing of this agreement has paved the way for 5000 indian pilgrims to visit the holy site without a visa on a daily basis under the agreement the pilgrims would come in the morning and return in the evening after visiting gurdwara darbar sahib each visitor would be required to pay usd 20 as a service charge which as per pakistan foreign offices dg south asia  saarc mohammad faisal would only cover onethird of the current operational cost india however had urged pakistan to waive off

following mughal gardens the badshahi mosque urdu بادشاہی مسجد is an iconic mughalera congregational mosque in lahore capital of the pakistani province of punjab the mosque is located opposite of lahore fort in the outskirts of the walled city  and is widely considered to be one of lahores most iconic landmarks the badshahi mosque was built between 1671 and 1673 and by the mughal emperor aurangzeb the mosque is an important example of mughal architecture with an exterior that is decorated with carved red sandstone with marble inlay it remains the largest mosque of the mughalera and is the thirdlargest mosque in pakistan in 1799 during the rule of ranjit singh of the sikh empire the mosques courtyard was used as a stable and its hujras cells as soldiers quarters when the british empire took control of lahore in 1846 it was used as a garrison until 1852 subsequently the badshahi mosque authority was established to oversee its restoration as a place of worship it is now one of pakistans most iconic sights the sixth mughal emperor aurangzeb chose lahore as the site for his new mosque aurangzeb unlike the previous emperors was not a major patron of art and architecture and instead focused during much of his reign on various military conquests which added to the mughal realm the mosque was built to commemorate aurangzebs military campaigns in southern india in particular against the maratha emperor shivaji as a symbol of the mosques importance it was built directly across from the lahore fort and its alamgiri gate which was concurrently built by aurangzeb during construction of the mosque the mosque was commissioned in 1671 with construction overseen by the emperors foster brother and governor of lahore muzaffar hussein  also known by the name fidai khan koka after only two years of construction the mosque was opened in 1673 on 7 july 1799 the sikh army of ranjit singh took control of lahore after the capture of the city maharaja ranjit singh used its vast courtyard as a stable for his army horses and its 80 hujras small study rooms surrounding the courtyard as quarters for his soldiers and as magazines for military stores in 1818 he built a marble edifice in the hazuri bagh facing the mosque known as the hazuri bagh baradari which he used as his official royal court of audience marble slabs for the baradari may have been plundered by the sikhs from other monuments in lahore in 1839 after his death construction of a samadhi in his memory was begun by his son and successor kharak singh at a site adjacent to the mosque during the first anglosikh war in 1841 ranjit singhs son sher singh used the mosques large minarets for placement of zamburahs or light guns which were used to bombard the supporters of chand kaur who had taken refuge in the besieged lahore fort in one of these bombardments the forts diwaneaam hall of public audience was destroyed but was subsequently rebuilt in the british era during this time henri de la rouche a french cavalry officer employed in the army of sher singh also used a tunnel connecting the badshahi mosque to the lahore fort to temporarily store gunpowder in 1849 the british seized control of lahore from the sikh empire during the british raj the mosque and the adjoining fort continued to be used as a military garrison the 80 cells built into the walls surrounding its vast courtyard were demolished by the british after the indian rebellion of 1857 so as to prevent them from being used for antibritish activities the cells were replaced by open arcades known as dalans because of increasing muslim resentment against the use of the mosque as a military garrison the british set up the badshahi mosque authority in 1852 to oversee the restoration and to reestablish it as a place of religious worship from then onwards piecemeal repairs were carried out under the supervision of the badshahi mosque authority the building was officially handed back to the muslim community by john lawrence who was the viceroy of india the building was then reestablished as a mosque in april 1919 after the amritsar massacre a mixed sikh hindu and muslim crowd of an estimated 2500035000 gathered in the mosques courtyard in protest a speech by gandhi was read at the event by khalifa shujauddin who would later become speaker of the provincial assembly of the punjab extensive repairs commenced from 1939 onwards when sikandar hayat khan began raising funds for this purpose renovation was supervised by the architect nawab alam yar jung bahadur as khan was largely credited for extensive restorations to the mosque he was buried adjacent to the mosque in the hazuri bagh restoration works begun in 1939 continued after the independence of pakistan and were completed in 1960 at a total cost of 48 million rupees on the occasion of the 2nd islamic summit held at lahore on 22 february 1974 thirtynine heads of muslim states offered their friday prayers in the badshahi mosque including among others zulfiqar ali bhutto of pakistan faisal of saudi arabia muammar gaddafi yasser arafat and sabah iii alsalim alsabah of kuwait \\nin 1993 the badshahi mosque was included in a tentative list as a unesco world heritage site in 2000 the marble inlay in the main prayer hall was repaired in 2008 replacement work on the red sandstone tiles on the mosques large courtyard was initiated using red sandstone imported from the original mughal source near jaipur in the indian state of rajasthan as a gateway to the west and persia in particular lahore had a strong regional style which was heavily influenced by persian architectural styles earlier mosques such as the wazir khan mosque were adorned in intricate kashi kari or kashan style tile work from which the badshahi mosque would depart aurangzeb chose an architectural plan similar to that of shah jahans choice for the jama masjid in delhi though he built the badshahi mosque on a much larger scalecitation needed both mosques feature red sandstone with white marble inlay which is a departure from typical mosque design in lahore in which decoration is done by means of intricate tile work entrance to the mosque complex is via a twostorey edifice built of red sandstone which is beautifully and elaborately decorated with framed and carved paneling on ea of its facades the edifice features a muqarna an architectural feature from the middle east that was first introduced into mughal architecture with construction of the nearby and ornate wazir khan mosque the mosques full name masjid abul zafar muhyuddin mohammad

pakistan the fortress is located at the northern end of walled city of lahore and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares 49 acres it contains 21 notable monuments some of which date to the era of emperor akbar the lahore fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century when the mughal empire was at the height of its splendor and opulence though the site of the lahore fort has been inhabited for millennia the first record of a fortified structure at the site was regarding an 11thcentury mudbrick fort the foundations of the modern lahore fort date to 1566 during the reign of emperor akbar who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both islamic and hindu motifs additions from the shah jahan period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid persian floral designs while the forts grand and iconic alamgiri gate was constructed by the last of the great mughal emperors aurangzeb and faces the renowned badshahi mosque after the fall of the mughal empire lahore fort was used as the residence of emperor ranjit singh founder of the sikh empire the sikhs made several additions to the fort it then passed to the control of the east india company after they annexed punjab following their victory over the sikhs at the battle of gujrat in february 1849 in 1981 the fort was inscribed as a unesco world heritage site for its outstanding repertoire of mughal monuments dating from the era when the empire was at its artistic and aesthetic zenith the fort is located in the northern part of lahores old walled city the forts alamgiri gate is part of an ensemble of buildings which along with the badshahi mosque roshnai gate and samadhi of ranjit singh form a quadrangle around the hazuri bagh the minarepakistan and iqbal park are adjacent to the northern boundary of the fort though the site is known to have been inhabited for millennia the origins of lahore fort are obscure and traditionally based on various myths the first historical reference to a fort at the site is from the 11th century during the rule of mahmud of ghazni the fort was made of mud and was destroyed in 1241 by the mongols during their invasion of lahore a new fort was constructed in 1267 at the site by sultan balban of the mamluk dynasty of the delhi sultanate the rebuilt fort was destroyed in 1398 by the invading forces of timur only to be rebuilt by mubarak shah sayyid in 1421  in the 1430s the fort was occupied by shaikh ali of kabul it later remained under the control of the lodi dynasty until lahore was captured by the mughal emperor babur in 1526 the present design and structure of the fort trace its origins to 1575 when the mughal emperor akbar occupied the site as a post to guard the northwest frontier of the empire the strategic location of lahore  between the mughal territories and the strongholds of kabul multan and kashmir necessitated the dismantling of the old mudfort and fortification with solid brick masonry lofty palaces were built over time along with lush gardens notable akbar period structures included the doulat khanaekhasoam jharokaedarshan and akbari gate many akbari structures were modified or replaced by subsequent rulers emperor jahangir first mentions his alterations to the fort in 1612 when describing the maktab khana jahangir also added the kala burj pavilion which features europeaninspired angels on its vaulted ceiling british visitors to the fort noted christian iconography during the jahangir period with paintings of the madonna and jesus found in the fort complex in 1606 guru arjan of the sikh faith was imprisoned at the fort before his death jahangir bestowed the massive picture wall a 1450 feet 440\\xa0m by 50 feet 15\\xa0m wall which is exquisitely decorated with a vibrant array of glazed tile faience mosaics and frescoes on the spandrels of the large arched panels below jahangirs khwabgah the imperial bedchamber are azdahas or winged dragons from ancient persian mythology cupbearing angel figures herons cranes and other flying birds many of the scenes displayed on this picture wall illustrate the court life of the mughal sovereigns their sports and their pastimes one of the finest panels shows four horsemen playing the noble game of chaughan nowadays known as polo most prominent are those relating to elephant fights which were one of the favourite recreations of the mughal court the mosque of mariyam zamani begum was built adjacent to the forts of eastern walls during the reign of jahangir while the mosque likely served as a friday congregational mosque for members of the royal court it was not financed by jahangir although it likely required his approval the foundation of this mosque was laid by the empress mariamuzzamani in the year 1611 and the construction was completed on the order of her son jahangir in her honor shah jahans first contribution to the fort commenced in the year of his coronation 1628 and continued until 1645 shah jahan first ordered the construction of the diwaniaam in the style of a chehel sotoun  a persian style 40pillar public audience hall though construction of the shah burj commenced under jahangir shah jahan was displeased with its design and appointed asif khan to oversee reconstruction shah jahans shah burj forms a quadrangle with the famous sheesh mahal and naulakha pavilion both are attributed to shah jahan although the naulakha pavilion may be a later addition possibly from the sikh era the white marble moti masjid or pearl mosque also dates from the shah jahan period emperor aurangzeb built the alamgiri gate whose semicircular towers and domed pavilions are a widely recognised symbol of lahore that was once featured on pakistani currency the mughals lost the fort to the afghan durranis who in turn briefly lost the fort to maratha forces before being recaptured by the durranis the fort was then captured by the bhangi misl  one of the 12 sikh misls of punjab that ruled lahore from 1767 until 1799 the fort fell to the army of ranjit singh who took lahore from the bhangi misl in 1799 during their occupation of the fort the sikhs made many additions to the fort and repurposed portions of it for their own use the famed hazuri bagh garden and its central baradari were constructed during sikh rule to celebrate the maharajas capture of the kohinoor diamond ranjit singh used the forts summer palace as his own residence while the moti masjid was repurposed as a gurdwara called moti mandir and later used as royal treasury the sehdari pavilion or threedoored pavilion was added to the fort during this period as was the ath dara or eightdoored pavilion the forts naag temple and loh temple were also constructed during sikh rule while the mai jindan haveli was extensively modified kharak singh haveli was also added the forts northern outer wall parallel to the picture wall was constructed during this period the forts diwaniaam was destroyed in 1841 when the son of ranjit singh sher singh bombarded the fort in his fight against chand kaur maharaja ranjit singhs elder son and successor kharak singh was born in the fort to his wife maharani datar kaur the youngest son of ranjit singh  maharaja duleep singh was born at the forts mai jindan haveli in 1838  duleep singh had signed the treaty of bhyroval in 1847 that brought the sikh empire to an effective end the fort and the city had remained under the control of ranjit singhs family until the fall of the sikh empire in 1849 the british occupied the fort after their conquest of lahore and made several modifications to it primarily involving conversion of existing buildings for colonial use including hospitals and barracks for the british military excavations in 1959 in front of diwaniam led to the discovery of a gold coin dated 1025 ce belonging to mahmud ghaznavi the coin was unearthed at the depth of 25 feet 76\\xa0m from the lawn the cultural layers were continuous to the depth of 15 feet 46\\xa0m indicating that the fort was inhabited by people even before his conquest other premughal objects unearthed in the excavation included terracotta depicting mother goddess horses bulls and other figures of hindu origin the fort along with the mughal garden at shalimar was designated as a world heritage site by unesco in 1981 while relaying the deteriorated floor of akbari gate in april 2007 three floors in the fort were unearthed belonging to the british sikh and mughal periods the floor of the british sikh and mughal periods was constructed with bricks burnt bricks and pebbles respectively the latter either built during jahangirs or shah jahans era was the hallmark of mughals the fort is divided into two sections first the administrative section which is well connected with main entrances and includes gardens and diwanekhas for royal audiences the second a private and concealed residential section is divided into courts in the north and accessible through elephant gate  it also contains sheesh mahal spacious bedrooms and small gardens the exterior walls are decorated with blue persian kashi tiles the original entrance faces the maryam zamani mosque and the larger alamgiri gate opens towards hazuri bagh through the majestic badshahi mosque influence of hindu architecture is seen in the zoomorphic corbels the naulakha pavilion is an iconic sight of the lahore fort built in 1633 during the shah jahan period that is made of prominent white marble and known for its distinctive curvilinear roof it cost around 900000 rupees an exorbitant amount at the time the structure derives its name from the urdu word for 900000 naulakha the naulakha pavilion served as a personal chamber and was located to the west of the sheesh mahal in the northern section of the fort the pavilion served as inspiration for rudyard kipling who named his vermont home naulakha in honour of the pavilion the structure was originally inlaid with precious and semiprecious stones it reflects a mixture of contemporary traditions at the time of its construction with a slopingroof based on a bengali style and a baldachin from europe which makes evident the imperial as well as the religious function of the pavilion the marble shades of the pavilion are capped with merlons to hide the view from the grounds emperor jahangir ordered the construction of the massive picture wall which is considered to be the greatest artistic triumph of the lahore fort unlike the red fort and agra fort lahore forts ramparts were made of brick rather than red stone the monumental picture wall is a large section of the outer wall which is exquisitely decorated with a vibrant array of glazed tile faience mosaics and frescoes the embellished wall stretches over much of the forts northern and western walls and measures approximately 1450 feet 440\\xa0m by 50 feet 15\\xa0m  the wall contains 116 panels which depict a myriad of subjects including elephant fights angels and polo games that do not form a cohesive narrative each can be viewed in isolation though begun under jahangir the picture wall was decorated throughout the 1620s and may have been completed under the reign of his son shah jahan the picture wall was badly neglected and suffered from disrepair and damage conservation works at the site began in 2015 by the aga khan trust for culture and walled city of lahore authority which together have also restored other lahore landmarks such as the wazir khan mosque and shahi hammam detailed documentation of the wall using 3d scanner was completed in july 2016 after which conservation work would start the sheesh mahal the palace of mirrors urdu شیش محل is located within jahangirs shah burj block in the northernwestern corner of the lahore fort it was constructed under the reign of mughal emperor shah jahan in 163132 by mirza ghiyas begh the grandfather of mumtaz mahal and father of nur jahan the ornate white marble pavilions walls are decorated with frescoes and are inlaid with pietra dura and complex mirrorwork known as āinakāri it is among the bestknown monuments of lahore fort and forms the jewel in the forts crown the distinctive shah jahani style is reflected in the extensive use of white marble and hierarchical accents of the construction sheesh mahal was reserved for personal use by the imperial family and close aides during the sikh empire shah burj became ranjit singhs favourite place who built a harem on top of the sheesh mahal this was also the place where he would display his prized possession the kohinoorcircular reference located directly beneath the sheesh mahal and shah burj quadrangle is the summer palace also known as the pari mahal or fairy palace the palace is a labyrinth of chambers that date from the shah jahan period they were used as a residence during hot weather months as they were cooled by effective ventilation systems that channelled cool breezes into the palace the palaces flooring system also helped cool the space  its floors were made of two layers that were separated by a layer of water pumped in from the ravi river cool water perfumed by roses flowed through an elaborate system of 42 waterfalls and cascades throughout the palace the palace was historically only accessible from the overlying sheesh mahal though a new entrance was built by the british near hathi pul or elephant stairs its walls were decorated with intricate frescoes and marble inlay that have been severely deteriorate by layers of subsequent whitewashing and centuries of dampness passage tunnels also exist that lead from the palace to the forts exterior where the river ravi once flowed suggesting that it may have been part of an escape tunnel designed to allow occupants to flee in case of attack the summer palace remained in use during the sikh period under the reign of ranjit singh after the defeat of the sikh empire in the second anglosikh war it went into the hands of the east india company and in 1858 into the hands of the british raj and its appointed agents and executors beginning in world war 2 the summer palace was used as a storehouse for the british civil defence department and remained in use by pakistan until 1973 the buildings structural integrity was affected by its use as a storehouse as of 2014 the walled city of lahore

pavilion feature paintings in a europeaninfluenced style of angels which symbolize the virtuosity of king solomon who is regarded as the ideal ruler in the quran and a ruler with whom jahangir identified angels directing djinns are also painted on tiles in the ceiling which also reference king solomon kala burj was used as a summer pavilion in the northeast corner of the khilawat khana

added during the sikh era the collection of buildings surrounding the quadrangle situated between jahangirs quadrangle and khilawat khana is referred to as shah jahans quadrangle in contrast to the

the fort though named for jahangir construction on the site began during the reign of akbar but was completed in 1620 under jahangir akbars syncretic style is noted in the quadrangle as it employs column brackets carved in the form of animals the quadrangles layout differs from other mughal quadrangles which are based upon the layout of a persian paradise garden and instead is formed by concentric rectangles with a fountain in its centre the diwaniaam was built by shah jahan in 1628 in a prominent part of the fort immediately south of jahangirs quadrangle it was built style of a chehel sotoun  a persian style 40pillar public audience hall  in a style similar to the diwaniaam at the agra fort the diwaniaam was used as a hall for the emperors to hold an audience with commoners

both the monuments to the list in 2000 pakistan sent a letter to the organization to include both the sites in list of world heritage in danger and sought help to restore the damaged part of the outer walls and hydraulic works of shalamar gardens  in april 2006 it was reported that officials had urged unesco to remove the name of the fort from the list of endangered world heritage sites because of extensive restoration work funded by norway hong kong the united kingdom and france restoration projects included works at the sheesh mahal alamgiri gate and hazuri bagh after years of extensive renovation and restoration work the fort and shalimar gardens were removed from the endangered list in june 2012 though in 1990 unesco had ordered the punjab archaeological department to bar the use of the fort for state or private functions on account of historical significance a wedding reception was held in violation on 23 december 2010 the antiquities act of 1975 which prohibits the use of historical places to protect them from damage was violated in the following month by hosting a dinner in the diwanikhas conservation works at the picture wall began in 2015 by the aga khan trust for

sites in the world spread over an area of 10 kilometres near the city of thatta in the pakistani province of sindh the site houses approximately 500000 to 1 million tombs built over the course of a 400year period makli necropolis features several large funerary monuments belonging to royalty various sufi saints and esteemed scholars the site was inscribed as a unesco world heritage site in 1981 as an outstanding testament to sindhi civilization between the 14th and 18th centuries makli necropolis is located in the town of makli which is located on a plateau approximately 6 kilometres from the city of thatta the capital of lower sindh until the 17th century it lies approximately 98\\xa0km east of karachi near the apex of the indus river delta in southeastern sindh the southernmost point of the site is approximately 5 miles north of the ruins of the medieval kallankot fort the site and nearby hills are said to derive their name from a legend in which a hajj pilgrim stopped at the site and erupted into spiritual ecstasy declaring the site to be makkah for him the sufi saint sheikh hamad jamali is then said to have named the site makli or little makkah after hearing the story of the pilgrim the sufi saint poet and scholar shaikh jamali established a khanqah or sufi gathering site at makli and was eventually buried there the 14th century samma ruler jam tamachi venerated the saint and wished to be interred near the saint beginning the tradition of using makli as a funerary site the site rose to prominence as a major funerary site during under the rule of the samma dynasty who had made their capital near thatta the most architecturally significant tombs at the site date from around the time of the mughal era between 1570 and 1640 ce makli necropolis occupies 10 square kilometres housing at least 500000 tombs it stretches from pir patho at the southern end of the makli hills northward in a roughly diamond shape its eastern edge is formed by the makli hills ridge the largest monuments are generally found at the southern edge of the site though the samma tombs are found in the north the funerary architecture of the largest monuments synthesizes muslim hindu persian mughal and gujarati influences in the style of lower sindh that became known as the chaukhandi style named after the chaukhandi tombs near karachi the chaukhandi style came to incorporate slabs of sandstone that were carefully carved by stonemasons into intricate and elaborate designs the earliest tombs displayed three to six slabs of stone stacked on top of one another into the shape of a small pyramid evolving funerary architecture then incorporated small plinths by the 15th century decorated rosettes and circular patterns began to be incorporated into the tombs more complex patterns and arabic calligraphy with biographical information of the interred body then emerged  larger monuments dating from later periods included corridors and some designs inspired by cosmology pyramidal structures from the 16th century feature the use of minarets topped with floral motifs in a style unique to tombs dating from the turkic trakhan dynasty structures from the 17th century at the leilo sheikh part of the cemetery feature large tombs that resemble jain temples from afar with prominent influence from the nearby region of gujarat several of the larger tombs feature carvings of animals warriors and weaponry – a practice uncommon to muslim funerary monuments later tombs at the site are sometimes made entirely of brick with only a sandstone slab the largest structures in the most archetypal chaukhandi style feature domed yellow sandstone canopies that were plastered white with wooden doorways in a style that reflects central asian and persian influences the size of the dome denoted the prominence of the buried individual with undersides embellished with carved floral patterns the underside of some canopies feature lotus flowers a symbol commonly associated with hinduism some tombs came to feature extensive blue tilework typical of sindh the use of funerary pavilions eventually expanded beyond lower sindh and influenced funerary architecture in neighbouring gujarat the impressive royal mausolea are divided into two major clusters namely samma cluster and  tarkhan arghun and mughals cluster the first cluster has tombs from  the samma period while tombs from the tarkhan arghun and mughals periods are clustered together tombs dating from the samma dynasty are clustered together in a 5acre section at the northern end of the necropolis the samma were rajput princes who seized control of thatta in 1335 samma tombs are strongly influenced by gujarati styles and incorporate muslim and hindu decorative elements the tomb of the king jam nizamuddin ii completed in 1510 is an impressive square structure measuring 114 metres on each side it was built of sandstone and decorated with floral and geometric medallions the cuboid shape of the tomb may be inspired by the kaaba in makkah its dome was never built thus leaving the interior exposed to the elements the monument features a large and intricately carved gujaratistyle jharoka or balcony and a small peak atop it which make the tomb resemble a temple the exterior features 14 bands of decorative motifs that feature both quranic verses and hindu symbols though in keeping with islamic tradition all decoration takes the form of geometric patterns with the sole exception of a frieze depicting local ducks the tomb of jam nizamuddins adoptive son darya khan resembles a rajasthani fort and was built after his death in 1521 darya khan had been born a slave but rose to prominence as a general after defeating an arghun army in battle he was granted the title hero of sindh and was eventually made madrul muham or prime minister the tomb of isa khan tarkhan i who ruled from 1554 to 1565 represents a departure from the funerary architecture of the sammas the tomb features a distinctly new cenotaphstyle and is laid out in a rectangular shape with its inner walls entirely covered with quranic verses the tomb also has an area dedicated for the graves of 5 of his royal ladies the mausoleum of isa khan hussain ii tarkhan d 1651 features a twostory stone building with cupolas and balconies the tomb is said to have been built during isas lifetime upon completion legend states that isa ordered the hands of the craftsmen to be cut off so that they would not be able to make another monument to rival his own the tomb of jan beg tarkhan d 1600 is an octagonal brick structure whose dome is covered in blue and turquoise glazed tiles pavilion or canopy tombs chattri maqbara or umbrella tomb are another typical indoislamic architectural feature as well as enclosure tombs the mughul period is represented by many tombs on the southern side of the necropolis including the mausoleum of mirza jani and mirza ghazi baig that of nawab shurfa khan the enclosure of mirza baqi baig uzbek and of mirza jan baba as well as the impressive restored tomb of nawab isa khan tarkhan the younger makli necropolis was designated a unesco world heritage site in 1981 the sites structural integrity has been affected by siltation encroachment poor site management vandalism and solid waste the 2010 pakistan floods further compounded the sites deterioration general view of the site some monuments feature corridors with roofs supported by intricately carved sandstone some mausolea such as that of dean shurfa khan feature strong architectural influences from central asia jam nizamuddin iis tomb features a jharoka that displays gujarati influences the tomb of isa khan hussain ii is one of the most notable monuments at the site tomb of mirza jani and mirza ghazi baig quranic artwork at a

culture of sindh and the dadu district administration following allegations of poor construction and favoritism in award of contracts an enquiry was instituted in 2005 the enquiry commissions report indicated that the restoration works were poorly done with cement and new stone work without conforming to the venice charter for the conservation and restoration of monuments and sites and recommended stoppage of further work on the fort based on this report further restoration work was suspended in 2006 derawar fort punjabi urdu قِلعہ ڈیراور is a fortress in ahmadpur east tehsil of

haripur district of khyber pakhtunkhwa in 326 bce alexander the great gained control of the city without a battle taxila having a too weak army  it was immediately surrendered to greeks by the locals old taxila was for a time the capital city of ancient gāndhāra situated on the eastern shore of the indus river—the pivotal junction of the indian subcontinent and central asia it was founded around 1000 bce some ruins at taxila date to the time of the achaemenid persian empire followed successively by the maurya empire the indogreek kingdom the indoscythians and the kushan empire owing to its strategic location taxila has changed hands many times over the centuries with many polities vying for its control when the great ancient trade routes connecting these regions ceased to be important the city sank into insignificance and was finally destroyed in the 5th century by the invading hunas in mid19th century british india ancient taxilas ruins were rediscovered by british archaeologist alexander cunningham in 1980 unesco designated taxila as a world heritage site by some accounts the university of ancient taxila is considered to be one of the earliest universities or education centre in south asia other scholars do not consider it to have been a university in the modern sense in that the teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges and there did not seem to have existed purposebuilt lecture halls and residential quarters in the city in a 2010 report the global heritage fund identified taxila as one of 12 worldwide sites that were on the verge of irreparable loss and damage citing insufficient management development pressure looting and armed conflict as primary threats however significant preservation efforts have since been carried out by the pakistani government which has resulted in the sites recategorization as wellpreserved by different international publications because of the extensive preservation efforts and upkeep taxila is one of punjabs popular tourist spots attracting up to one million tourists every year in ancient times taxila was known as takṣaśilā in sanskrit per iast and as takkhasilā in pali the citys sanskrit name translates to city of cut stone or rock of taksha in reference to a story in the ramayana that states that the city was founded by bharata the younger brother of the hindu deity rama and named in honour of bharatas son taksha the citys modern name however is derived from the ancient greek rendering noted in ptolemys geography the greeklanguage transcription of taxila became universally favoured over time and both the sanskrit and pali names fell out of use faxian a chinese buddhist pilgrim who visited the city via the silk road had given its names meaning as cutoff head with the help of a jataka he had interpreted it to be the place where gautama buddha—during a previous birth as pusa or chandaprabha—cut off his head to feed a hungry lion this tradition still persists with the area in front of sirkap also meaning cutoff head which was known in the 19th century as babur khana house of tiger alluding to the place where gautama buddha had offered his head in addition a hill range to south of the taxila valley is called margala lit\\u2009cutoff throat in vedic texts such as the shatapatha brahmana it is mentioned that the vedic philosopher uddalaka aruni c

between vaishampayana a pupil of the sage vyasa and king janamejaya it is traditionally believed that the story was first recited by vaishampayana at the behest of vyasa during the snake sacrifice performed by janamejaya at takshashila the audience also included ugrashravas an itinerant bard who would later recite the story to a group of priests at an ashram in the naimisha forest from where the story was further disseminated the kuru kingdoms heir parikshit grandson of arjuna is said to have been enthroned at takshashila the ramayana describes takshashila as a magnificent city famed for its wealth which was founded by bharata the younger brother of rama bharata who also founded nearby pushkalavati installed his two sons taksha and pushkala as the rulers of the two cities in the buddhist jatakas taxila is described as the capital of the kingdom of gandhara and a great centre of learning with worldfamous teachers the jatakas mention nonbuddhist institutions and teachers in taxila they show the predominance of vedic and technical disciplines including law medicine and military science the takkasila jataka more commonly known as the telapatta jataka tells the tale of a prince of benares who is told that he would become the king of takkasila if he could reach the city within seven days without falling prey to the yakshinis who waylaid travellers in the forest according to the dipavamsa one of taxilas early kings was a kshatriya named dipankara who was succeeded by twelve sons and grandsons kuñjakarṇa mentioned in the avadanakalpalata is another king associated with the city in the jain tradition it is said that rishabha the first of the tirthankaras visited taxila millions of years ago his footprints were subsequently consecrated by bahubali who erected a throne and a dharmachakra wheel of the law over them several miles in height and circumference the region around taxila was settled by the neolithic era with some ruins at taxila dating to 1000 bce ruins dating from the early harappan period around 1300 bce have also been discovered in the taxila area though the area was eventually abandoned after the collapse of the indus valley civilisation the earliest settled occupation in taxila valley was found at sarai khola located 2\\xa0km to the southwest of taxila museum where three radiocarbon dates from period i suggest the site was first occupied between the late 4th and early 3rd millennium bce with deposits of polished stone celts chert blades and a distinctive type of highly burnished pottery that shows clear signs of the use of woven baskets in the manufacturing process and the application of a slurry to the exterior surface periods ia and ii at sarai khola seem to show continuity from period i with the appearance of red burnished wares however kot dijistyle wares were found in greater numbers and the kot dijistyle forms show signs of having been wheelthrown marking a clear technological change from the period i material seven radiocarbon dates were also taken from the earlier and later period iikot diji and seem to show this phase dates from the midlate 3rd to early 2nd millennium bce gandhara was an ancient indoaryan kingdom of western south asia whose existence is attested during the iron age the capital of the kingdom was in taxila the first major settlement at taxila in hathial mound was established around 1000 bce by 900 bce the city was already involved in regional commerce as discovered pottery shards reveal trading ties between the city and puṣkalāvatī later taxila was inhabited at bhir mound dated to some time around the period 800525 bce with these early layers bearing grooved red burnished ware archaeological excavations show that the city may have grown significantly during the rule of

pakistan emperor darius spent the winter of 516515 bce in the gandhara region surrounding taxila and prepared to conquer the indus valley which he did in 515 bce after which he appointed scylax of caryanda to explore the indian ocean from the mouth of the indus to the suez darius then returned to persia via the bolan pass the region continued under achaemenid suzerainty under the reign of xerxes i and continued under achaemenid rule for over a century taxila was sometimes ruled as part of the gandhara kingdom whose capital was pushkalavati particularly after the achaemenid period but taxila sometimes formed its own independent district or citystate during his invasion of the indus valley alexander the great was able to gain control of taxila ancient greek τάξιλα in 326 bce without a battle as the city was surrendered by its ruler king omphis āmbhi greek historians accompanying alexander described taxila as wealthy prosperous and well governed arrian writes that alexander was welcomed by the citizens of the city and he offered sacrifices and celebrated a gymnastic and equestrian contest there on alexanders death in 323 bce the province and much of the once achaemenid territories would pass to his general seleucus i nicator and founder of the successor seleucid empire by 303 bce the seleucid empires satraps in south asia had been formally annexed by the expanding mauryan empire following the seleucid–mauryan war with the provincial capital and center of higher education at of taxila now under the control of chandragupta maurya his advisor kautilyachanakya was said to have taught at taxilas university under the reign of ashoka the great chandraguptas grandson the city was made a great seat of buddhist learning though the city was home to a minor rebellion during this time taxila was founded in a strategic location along the ancient royal highway that connected the mauryan capital at pataliputra in bihar with ancient peshawar puṣkalāvatī and onwards towards central asia via kashmir bactria and kāpiśa taxila thus changed hands many times over the centuries with many empires vying for its control in the 2nd century bce taxila was annexed by the indogreek kingdom of bactria indogreeks built a new capital sirkap on the opposite bank of the river from taxila during this new period of bactrian greek rule several dynasties like antialcidas likely ruled from the city as their capital during lulls in greek rule the city managed profitably on its own to independently control several local trade guilds who also minted most of the citys autonomous coinage in about the 1st century bce or 1st century ce an indoscythian king named azilises had three mints one of which was at taxila and struck coins with obverse legends in greek and kharoṣṭhī the last greek king of taxila was overthrown by the indoscythian chief maues around 90 bce gondophares founder of the indoparthian kingdom conquered taxila around 20 bce and made taxila his capital according to early christian legend thomas the apostle visited gondophares iv around 46 ce possibly at taxila given that city was gondophares capital city around the year 50 ce the greek neopythagorean philosopher apollonius of tyana allegedly visited taxila which was described by his biographer philostratus writing some 200 years later as a fortified city laid out on a symmetrical plan similar in size to nineveh modern archaeology confirms this description inscriptions dating to 76 ce demonstrate that the city had come under kushan rule by that time after the city was captured from the parthians by kujula kadphises founder of the kushan empire the great kushan ruler kanishka later founded sirsukh the most recent of the ancient settlements at taxila in the midfourth century ce the gupta empire occupied the territories in eastern gandhara establishing a kumaratyas post at taxila the city became well known for its trade links including silk sandalwood horses cotton silverware pearls and spices it is during this time that the city heavily features in classical indian literature – both as a centre of culture as well as a militarised border city taxilas university remained in existence during the travels of chinese pilgrim faxian who visited taxila around 400 ce he wrote that taxilas name translated as the severed head and was the site of a story in the life of buddha where he gave his head to a man the kidarites vassals of the hephthalite empire are known to have invaded taxila in c 450 ce though repelled by the gupta emperor skandagupta the city would not recover probably on account of the strong hunnic presence in the area breakdown of trade as well as the threeway war among persia the kidarite state and the huns in western gandhara the white huns and alchon huns swept over gandhāra and punjab around 470 ce causing widespread devastation and destruction of taxilas famous buddhist monasteries and stupas a blow from which the city would never recover from 500 ce to 540 ce the city languished  after falling under the control of the hunnic empire ruled by mihirakula  mihirakula presided over some destruction of buddhist sites  monasteries and hindu temples across northwestern regions of the indian subcontinent xuanzang visited india between 629 and 645 ce taxila which was desolate and halfruined was visited by him in 630 ce and found most of its sangharamas still ruined and desolate only a few monks remained there he adds that the kingdom had become a dependency of kashmir with the local leaders fighting amongst themselves for power he noted that it had some time previously been a subject of kapisa by the ninth century it became a dependency of the kabul shahis the turki shahi dynasty of kabul was replaced by the hindu shahi dynasty which was overthrown by mahmud of ghazni with the defeat of trilochanpala alusaifans king during the reign of almutasim is said to have converted to islam by albiladhuri and abandoned his old faith due to the death of his son despite having priests of a temple pray for his recovery said to be located between kashmir multan and kabul alusaifan is identified with kingdom of taxila by some authors by some accounts taxila was considered to be one of the earliest or the earliest universities in the world others do not consider it a university in the modern sense in that the teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges and there did not seem to have existed purposebuilt lecture halls and residential quarters in taxila in contrast to the later nalanda university in eastern india taxila became a noted centre of learning including the religious teachings of historical vedic religion and buddhism at least several centuries bce and continued to attract students from around the old world until the destruction of the city in the 5th century it has been suggested that at its height taxila exerted a sort of intellectual suzerainty over other centres of learning in india and its primary concern was not with elementary but higher education generally a student entered taxila at the age of sixteen the ancient and the most revered scriptures and the eighteen silpas or arts which included skills such as archery hunting and elephant lore were taught in addition to its law school medical school and school of military science students came to taxila from faroff places such as kashi kosala and magadha in spite of the long and arduous journey they had to undergo on account of the excellence of the learned teachers there all recognised as authorities on their respective subjects taxila had great influence on hindu culture and the sanskrit language it is perhaps best known for its association with chanakya also known as kautilya the strategist who guided chandragupta maurya and assisted in the founding of the mauryan empire chanakyas arthashastra the knowledge of economics is said to have been composed in taxilafailed verification the ayurvedic healer charaka also studied at taxila he also started teaching at taxila in the later periodunreliable source pāṇini the grammarian who codified the rules that would define classical sanskrit has also been part of the community at taxila the institution is significant in buddhist tradition since it is believed that the mahāyāna branch of buddhism took shape there jīvaka the court physician of the magadha emperor bimbisara who once cured the buddha and the buddhismsupporting ruler of kosala prasenajit are some important personalities mentioned in pali texts who studied at taxila no external authorities like kings or local leaders subjected the scholastic activities at taxila to their control each teacher formed his own institution enjoying complete autonomy in work teaching as many students as he liked and teaching subjects he liked without conforming to any centralised syllabus study terminated when the teacher was satisfied with the students level of achievement in general specialisation in a subject took around eight years though this could be lengthened or shortened in accordance with the intellectual abilities and dedication of the student in question in most cases the schools were located within the teachers private houses and at times students were advised to quit their studies if they were unable to fit into the social intellectual and moral atmosphere there knowledge was considered too sacred to be bartered for money and hence any stipulation that fees ought to be paid was vigorously condemnedcitation needed financial support came from the society at large as well as from rich merchants and wealthy parentscitation needed though the number of students studying under a single guru sometimes numbered in the hundreds teachers did not deny education even if the student was poor free boarding and lodging was provided and students had to do manual work in the householdcitation needed paying students such as princes were taught during the day while nonpaying ones were taught at night gurudakshina was usually expected at the completion of a students studies but it was essentially a mere token of respect and gratitude  many times being nothing more than a turban a pair of sandals or an umbrella in cases of poor students being unable to afford even that they could approach the king who would then step in and provide something not providing a poor student a means to supply his gurus dakshina was considered the greatest slur on a kings reputation examinations were treated as superfluous and not considered part of the requirements to complete ones studiescitation needed the process of teaching was critical and thorough unless one unit was mastered completely the student was not allowed to proceed to the nextcitation needed no convocations were held upon completion and no written degrees were awarded since it was believed that knowledge was its own reward using knowledge for earning a living or for any selfish end was considered sacrilegious students arriving at taxila usually had completed their primary education at home until the age of eight and their secondary education in the ashrams between the ages of eight and twelve and therefore came to taxila chiefly to reach the ends of knowledge in specific disciplines the sites of a number of important cities noted in ancient indian texts were identified by scholars early in the 19th century the lost city of taxila however was not identified until later in 186364 its identification was made difficult partly due to errors in the distances recorded by pliny in his naturalis historia which pointed to a location somewhere on the haro river two days march from the indus alexander cunningham the founder and the first directorgeneral of the archaeological survey of india noticed that this position did not agree with the descriptions provided in the itineraries of chinese pilgrims and in particular that of xuanzang the 7thcentury buddhist monk unlike pliny these sources noted that the journey to taxila from the indus took three days and not two cunninghams subsequent explorations in 1863–64 of a site at shahdheri convinced him that his hypothesis was correct now as hwen thsang on his return to china was accompanied by laden elephants his three days journey from takhshasila sic to the indus at utakhanda or ohind must necessarily have been of the same length as those of modern days and consequently the site of the city must be looked for somewhere in the neighbourhood of kâlakasarâi this site is found near shahdheri just one mile to the northeast of kâlakasarâi in the extensive ruins of a fortified city around which i was able to trace no less than 55 stupas of which two are as large as the great manikyala tope twenty eight

taxila archeological excavations stupa in taxila in the early centuries the centre of buddhist scholarship was the university of taxila kautilya was also a professor of politics and economics at taxila university taxila university is one of the oldest known universities in the world and it was the chief learning centre in ancient india thus the various centres of learning in different parts of the country became affiliated as it were to the educational centre or the central university of taxila which exercised a kind of intellectual suzerainty over the wide world of letters in india this shows that taxila was a seat not of elementary but higher education of colleges or a university as distinguished from schools the bodhisatta was once the youngest of one hundred sons of the king of benares he heard from the pacceka buddhas who took their meals in the palace that he would become king of takkasilā if he could reach it without falling a prey to the ogresses who waylaid travellers in the forest thereupon he set out with five of his brothers who wished to accompany him on the way through the forest the five in succession succumbed to the charms of the ogresses and were devoured one ogress followed the bodhisatta right up to the gates of takkasilā where the king took her into the palace paying no heed to the bodhisattas warning the king succumbed to her wiles and during the night the king and all the inhabitants of the palace were eaten by the ogress and her companions the people realising the sagacity and strength of will of the bodhisatta made him their king it may be observed at the outset that taxila did not possess any colleges or university in the modern sense of the term we come across several jātaka stories about the students and teachers of takshaśilā but not a single episode even remotely suggests that the different world renowned teachers living in that city belonged to a particular college or university of the modern type students from magadha traversed the vast distances of northern india in order to join the schools and colleges of taxila we learn from pali texts that brahmana youths khattiya princes and sons of setthis from rajagriha kashi kosala and other places went to taxila for learning the vedas and eighteen sciences and arts pāṇini and kautilya two masterminds of ancient times were also brought up in the academic traditions of taxila likewise jivaka the famous physician of bimbisara who cured the buddha learnt the science of medicine under a farfamed teacher at taxila and on his return was appointed courtphysician at magadha another illustrious product of taxila was the enlightened ruler of kosala prasenajit who is intimately associated with the events of the time of the buddha rohtas fort punjabi urdu قلعہ روہتاس  romanized qilā rohtās is a 16thcentury fortress located near the city of dina in jhelum district of the punjab province of pakistan raja todar mal the minister of the afghan king sher shah suri supervised the construction of the fort which is now one of the largest and most formidable in punjab the fort remains remarkably intact and was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 unesco called it an exceptional example of the muslim military architecture of central and south asia rohtas fort is in pakistan approximately 16 kilometres 99\\xa0mi northwest of jhelum and is near the city of dina the fort is 3 kilometres 19\\xa0mi from khukha and gaggar khurd it lies 8 kilometres 50\\xa0mi south of the grand trunk road one of asias oldest and longest major roads the historic badshahi road road once passed along the northern outer wall of the fort rohtas fort is situated on a hill in the tilla jogian range overlooking a gorge where the kahān river meets a seasonal stream called parnal khas the fort is positioned 915 metres 300\\xa0ft above its surroundings it is 819 metres 2687\\xa0ft above sea level and covers an area of 70 hectares 170 acres at the northern edge of the rohtas fort situated near the forts talaqi gate it overlooks gurdwara chowa sahib sher shah suri the afghan founder of the sur empire of india commissioned the rohtas fort on the advice of his generals who suggested him to adopt a scorched earth strategy to defeat the warring gakhar a local punjabi muslim tribe who were providing bold resistance to the surs near the salt range region in punjab pakistan thus the idea of the rohtas fort was conceived with sher shah suri laying down the foundation of the fort  the fort occupied a strategic position between the mountains of afghanistan and the plains of punjab preventing humayun from returning to india from his exile in persia its name celebrated the afghan king sher shah suris 1539 capture of the rohtas fort in the shahabad district of bihar from a hindu prince the construction of rohtas fort started in 1541 under the supervision of finance minister todar mal however its construction soon stopped when the local gakhar population was unwilling to work on the construction due to all the male tribesmen taking a vow to not cooperate with the surs lest be threatened with excommunication or expulsion thus todar mal wasnt able to find even one labourer to help him in the construction of the fort this was the case until he under the orders of sher shah suri raised the workers wages to such a degree that many of the gakhars became willing to help with the forts construction sher shah suri didnt live to see its completion as he died in 1545 before the fort was completed with sher shah suris death humayan returned to regain his rule of the punjab region rohtas fort was ceded to humayun in 1555 as a result the fort lost much of its defensive significance it was never popular with the mughals because of its plain military style and lack of gardens in the 1580s emperor akbar constructed the nearby attock fort that was a better fit to mughal interests akbar only stayed at rohtas fort for a single night emperor jahangir rested there for one night while traveling to kashmir he noted this fort was founded in a cleft and the strength of it cannot be imagined later after his victorious return from a forced exile in kabul jahangir convened his court at rohtas fort for a short time during the mughal era the fort was used almost continuously until 1707 the afsharid ruler nader shah camped at the fort during his invasion of the mughal empire after that it was used by the afghan durrani chieftain ahmad shah durrani during his invasions of punjab against the sikhs gurmukh singh lamba captured rothas fort in 1825 from nur khan a gakhar chief raja fazal din khan was the last to use rohtas fort for military purposes when he participated in a successful rebellion led by sher singh in the late 1830s however the fort never saw any fighting the sikh empire used the fort for administrative purposes until the british took the region in 1849 the designers of rohtas fort valued function over form its style

alexander the great during his invasion of the indus valley uch was an early stronghold of the delhi sultanate during the muslim conquest of the subcontinent it is also known as the home for the naqvibukharis after the migration from bukhara uch was a regional metropolitan centre between the 12th and 17th centuries and became refuge for muslim religious scholars fleeing persecution from other lands though uch is now a relatively small city it is renowned for its intact historic urban fabric and for its collection of shrines dedicated to muslim mystics sufis from the 12th15th centuries that are embellished with extensive tile work and were built in the distinct  architectural style of southern punjab uch sharif was previous known by the name of deogarh stronghold of giants until the 12th century  the origins of the citys current name are unclear in one legend jalaluddin surkhposh bukhari the renowned central asian sufi mystic from bukhara arrived in uch and converted the daughter of the towns ruler sunandapuri upon her conversion jalaluddin bukhari requested her to build a fortress which he named uch or high according to another version of the legend the princess converted by bukhari was actually a buddhist princess named ucha rani and the citys name derives from hers in another version of that legend ucha rani and her sister sita rani rulers of uch and sitapur both married bukhari uch was not universally recognized as the areas name for quite some time and the city was not referred to by early muslim historians by the name uch uch for example is likely the town recorded as bhatia that was invaded by mahmud of ghazni in 1006 uch sharif may have been founded in 325\\xa0bce by alexander the great as the city of alexandria on the indus greek ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ ἐν ἰνδῷ according to british officer and archaeologist alexander cunningham the city was reportedly settled by natives of the greek region of thrace and was located at the confluence of the acesines river with the indus uch was once located on the banks of the indus river though the river has since shifted its course and the confluence of the two rivers has shifted approximately 40\\xa0km 25 miles southwest in 712 ce muhammad bin qasim conquered uch few details exist of the city in the centuries prior to his invasion uch was probably the town recorded as bhatia  that was conquered in 1006 by mahmud of ghazni following the schism between the nizari and mustali sects of ismaili shiism in 1094 uch became a centre of nizari missionary activity for several centuries and today the town and surrounding region are littered with numerous tombs of prominent pīrs as well as pious daughters and wives of those sufi pirs the region around uch and multan remained centre of hindu vaishnavite and surya pilgrimage throughout the medieval era their interactions with ismaili tradition resulted in the creation of the satpanth tradition throughout this era uch was at the centre of a region that was steeped in both vedic and islamic traditions the city would later become a centre of suhrwadi sufism with the establishment of the order by bahauddin zakariya in nearby multan in the early 1200s muhammad of ghor conquered uch and nearby sultan in 1176 while it was still under the influence of the ismaili qarmatians the town was likely captured from the soomras based in sindh sindhs various dynasties had for centuries attempted to keep uch and multan under their sway soomra power was eroded by the advance of nasir addin qabacha of what would later become the mamluk dynasty of the delhi sultanate qabacha was declared governor of uch in 1204 under his rule uch became the principal city of upper sindh qabacha declared independence for his principality centred on uch and multan after the death of sultan aybak in 1211 before marching onwards to capture lahore thereby placing qabachas new uch sultanate in conflict with sultan iltutmish in delhi qabacha briefly lost control of uch to taj aldin yildiz though uch was quickly returned to qabachas rule while the power struggle ensued among qabacha and iltuthmish uch came under further pressure from the khwarazmian dynasty based in samarkand that had been displaced by the mongol armies of genghis khan following the defeat of his father by the mongols in the mid 1210s the last khwarazmian sultan jalal addin mingburnu sacked and conquered uch in 1224 after qabacha refused to aid him in a campaign against genghis khan jalal addin mingburnu was finally defeated by genghis khan in 1224 in a battle at uch and was forced to flee to persia khan  attacked multan on his return to iran in 1224 though sultan qabacha was able to successfully defend that city despite repeated invasions the city remained a great centre of muslim scholarship as evidenced by the appointment of the renowned persian historian minhajisiraj as chief of the citys firozi madrasa in 1228 qabachas forces weakened by mongol and khwarazmian invasions lost uch to sultan iltutmish of delhi and fled south to bhakkar in sindh where he was eventually captured and drowned in the indus river as punishment following the collapse of qabachas sultanate at the hands of mongols and khwarazmians and the degradation of lahore from years of conflict there muslim power in north india shifted away from punjab and towards the safer environs delhi one of uchs most celebrated saints jalaluddin surkhposh bukhari migrated to uch from bukhara in 1244–45 in 1245–46 the mongols again invaded uch under möngke khan after receiving aid from the local khokhar tribes in 1252 forces from delhi were sent to the region in order to secure uch from mongol raiders though uch was again raided in 1258 uch was raided yet again by mongols in 1304 and 1305 following the 1305 invasion uch came under the governorship of ghazi malik the governor of multan and depalpur who would later seize delhi and come to be known as ghiyath aldin tughluq founder of the tughlaq dynasty of the delhi sultanate uch was captured in 1398 by pir muhammad ibn jahangir grandson of tamerlane allowing khizr khan to regain control of the area before joining with the forces of the elder tamerlane

title mahmud shah during the rule of shah husayn langah large numbers of baloch settlers were invited to settle in the region the city was placed under the jagir governorship of a samma prince in the mid1400s muhammad ghaus gilani a descendant of the persian saint abdul qadir gilani established a khanqah monastery in uch thereby establishing the city as a centre of the qadiriyya sufi order which would later become the dominant  order of punjab following the death of shah husayn uchs samma rulers quickly allied themselves with baloch chieftain mir chakar rind guru nanak the founder of sikhism

northern sindh before falling to the forces of pashtun king sher shah suri in 1540 mughal emperor humayun entered uch in late 1540 but was not welcomed by the citys inhabitants and was defeated by the forces of sher shah suri the city reverted to arghun rule following the expulsion of humayun and the fall of sher shah suris shortlived empire uch sharif became a part of the mughal empire during the

custom and rites by not intermarrying with any other people the king having with infinite labour cleared a road for his army over the mountains advanced towards dera which was well fortified this

the former course of the ravi river which now runs 8\\xa0km 50\\xa0mi to the north the core of the harappan civilization extended over a large area from gujarat in the south across sindh and rajasthan and extending into punjab and haryana numerous sites have been found outside the core area including some as far east as uttar pradesh and as far west as sutkagendor on the makran coast of balochistan not far from iran the site of the ancient city contains the ruins of a bronze age fortified city which was part of the harappan civilisation centred in sindh and the punjab and then the cemetery h culture the city is believed to have had as many as 23500 residents and occupied about 150 hectares 370 acres with clay brick houses at its greatest extent during the mature harappan phase 2600 bc – 1900\\xa0bc which is considered large for its time per archaeological convention of naming a previously unknown civilisation by its first excavated site the indus valley civilisation is also called the harappan civilisation the ancient city of harappa was heavily damaged under british and french rule when bricks from the ruins were used as track ballast in the construction of the lahore–multan railwaycitation needed the current village of harappa is less than 1\\xa0km 062\\xa0mi from the ancient site although modern harappa has a legacy railway station from the british raj period it is a small crossroads town of 15000 people today  in 2005 a controversial amusement park scheme at the site was abandoned when builders unearthed many archaeological artefacts during the early stages of building work the harappan civilisation has its earliest roots in cultures such as that of mehrgarh approximately 6000 bc the two greatest cities mohenjodaro and harappa emerged c\\u20092600 bc along the indus river valley in punjab and sindh the civilisation with a possible writing system urban centres drainage infrastructure and diversified social and economic system was rediscovered in the 1920s also after excavations at mohenjodaro in sindh near larkana and harappa in west punjab south of lahore a number of other sites stretching from the himalayan foothills in the east punjab india in the north to gujarat in the south and east and to pakistani balochistan in the west have also been discovered and studied although the archaeological site at harappa was damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the lahoremultan railroad used brick from the harappa ruins for track ballast an abundance of artefacts have nevertheless been found\\nbecause of the reducing sealevels certain regions in late harappan period were abandoned \\n towards the end harappan civilisation lost features such as writing and hydraulic engineering as a result the ganges valley settlement gained prominence and ganges cities developed the earliest recognisably harappan sites date to 3500 bc this early phase lasts till around 2600 bc we then enter the mature phase from 2600 bc to 2000 bc this is when the great cities were at their height then from around 2000 bc we have a steady disintegration that lasts till 1400 bc – what is usually called late harappan there is no sign that the harappan cities were laid waste by invaders the evidence strongly points to natural causes a number of studies show that the area which is today the thar desert was once far wetter and that the climate gradually became drier the indus valley civilization was basically an urban culture sustained by surplus agricultural production and commerce the latter including trade with elam and sumer in southern mesopotamia both mohenjodaro and harappa are generally characterised as having differentiated living quarters flatroofed brick houses and fortified administrative or religious centers although such similarities have given rise to arguments for the existence of a standardised system of urban layout and planning the similarities are largely due to the presence of a semiorthogonal type of civic layout and a comparison of the layouts of mohenjodaro and harappa shows that they are in fact arranged in a quite dissimilar fashion the weights and measures of the indus valley civilisation on the other hand were highly standardised and conform to a set scale of gradations distinctive seals were used among other applications perhaps for the identification of property and shipment of goods although copper and bronze were in use iron was not yet employed cotton was woven and dyed for clothing wheat rice and a variety of vegetables and fruits were cultivated and a number of animals including the humped bull was domesticated as well as fowl for fighting  wheelmade pottery—some of it adorned with animal and geometric motifs—has been found in profusion at all the major indus sites a centralised administration for each city though not the whole civilisation has been inferred from the revealed cultural uniformity however it remains uncertain whether authority lay with a commercial oligarchy harappans had many trade routes along the indus river that went as far as the persian gulf mesopotamia and egypt some of the most valuable things traded were carnelian and lapis lazuli what is clear is that harappan society was not entirely peaceful with the human skeletal remains demonstrating some of the highest rates of injury 155 found in south asian prehistory examinations of harappan skeletons have often found wounds that are likely to have been inflicted in battle paleopathological analysis demonstrated that leprosy and tuberculosis were present at harappa with the highest prevalence of both disease and trauma present in the skeletons from area g an ossuary located southeast of the city walls furthermore rates of craniofacial trauma and infection increased through time demonstrating that the civilisation collapsed amid illness and injury the bioarchaeologists who examined the remains have suggested that the combined evidence for differences in mortuary treatment and epidemiology indicate that some individuals and communities at harappa were excluded from access to basic resources like health and safety the harappans had traded with ancient mesopotamia especially elam among other areas cotton textiles and agricultural products were the primary trading objects the harappan merchants also had procurement colonies in mesopotamia as well which served as trading centres they also traded extensively with people living in southern india near modernday karnataka to procure gold and copper from themcitation needed the excavators of the site have proposed the following chronology of harappas occupation period 1 occupation was thought to be around 7 to 10 hectares but following excavations and findings of pottery in mound e along with previously found mound ab pottery suggest ravihakra phase would have been extended together in both mounds to 25 hectares period 2 kot diji phase was extended in the same two mounds ab and e covering over 27 hectares in period 3 harappa phase the settlement reached 150 hectares by far the most exquisite and obscure artefacts unearthed to date are the small square steatite soapstone seals engraved with human or animal motifs a large number of seals have been found at such sites as mohenjodaro and harappa many bear pictographic inscriptions generally thought to be a form of writing or scriptcitation needed despite the efforts of philologists from all parts of the world and despite the use of modern cryptographic analysis the signs remain undeciphered it is also unknown if they reflect protodravidian or other nonvedic languages the ascribing of indus valley civilisation iconography and epigraphy to historically known cultures is extremely problematic in part due to the rather tenuous archaeological evidence for such claims as well as the projection of modern south asian political concerns onto the archaeological record of the area this is especially evident in the radically varying interpretations of harappan material culture as seen from both pakistan and indiabased scholarsoriginal researchcitation needed in february 2006 a school teacher in the village of sembiankandiyur in tamil nadu discovered a stone celt tool with an inscription estimated to be up to 3500 years old\\n indian epigraphist iravatham mahadevan postulated that the four signs were in the indus script and called the find the greatest archaeological discovery of a century in tamil nadu based on this evidence he goes on to suggest that the language used in the indus valley was of dravidian origin however the absence of a bronze age in south india contrasted with the knowledge of bronze making techniques in the indus valley cultures calls into question the validity of this hypothesis the area of the late harappan period consisted of areas of daimabad maharashtra and badakshan regions of afghanistan the area covered by this civilisation would have been very large with a distance of around 2400

province to gwadar in balochistan province it passes the towns of ormara and pasni the idea of exploiting the potential of the large coastal belt was under discussion for a long time the decision to build a port in gwadar was initially taken in the early 1990s when the hydrocarbonladen and mineralrich central asian republics gained independence after the breakup of the soviet union the construction of the makran coastal highway was essential to the development of the port of gwadar without the highway gwadar would have been an island sitting without the bridges that connect it with karachi in the south and the rest of pakistan and the larger world around in the north and the west another key connection of an established infrastructure in this part of the country it offers china a potential alternative to the vulnerable choke points in the malacca straits prior to the construction of the makran coastal highway in 2004 karachi was linked to gwadar via an uncarpeted jeep or dirt track the journey between karachi and gwadar used to take at least two days and took a heavy toll on the wear and tear of vehicles it was considered preferable to take the safer but longer route via quetta after completion of the makran coastal highway the average journey time between karachi and gwadar has been reduced to only 6 to 7 hours and transportation costs have also been reduced the makran coastal highway was planned and built by the government of pakistan with the following objectives the construction contract for the makran coastal highway was awarded to pakistans frontier

architects of ranikot fort are unknown it was formerly believed that the fort was built during the regimes of the sassanians the scythians the parthians or the bactrian greeks however more recent evidence shows that the fort originated under the talpurs and constructed during the administration of nawab wali muhammed leghari the prime minister of sindh during the talpur dynasty archaeologists point to the 17th century as the time of its first construction but sindh archaeologists now agree that some of the present structures were reconstructed by the talpur dynasty in 1812 at a cost of 12\\xa0million rupees sindh gazetteer 677 the battlements of ranikot formed the last capital of the amirs of sind when they were brought under the colonial rule of the british empire radiocarbon tests were conducted at the sann gate on the charcoal embedded in the mortar of a collapsed pillar of the eastern gate of the fort these tests have confirmed that this gate was probably renovated between the early part of the 18th century and the early part of the 19th century prior to britain invading the fort when the kalhoras or most likely the talpur mirs of sindh ruled over the area the fort is

mortar the fort is built in a zigzag form with four entry gates in the shape of a rhomboid the four gates are namely sann gate amri gate shahpere gate and mohan gate two of the gates facing eachclarification needed are crossed diagonally by the sann river the first gate is on the western side and is skirted by the river water and is difficult to approach the southern entry gate has a double doors gate within the gates there are two niches which have floral ornamentation and carved stones the sann gate is well preserved and can be climbed to reach the top of the fort from both sides to get a scenic view of the terrain around the fort this gate is also the entrance to the meeri the fort was first restored by nawab wali muhammed leghari who was the prime minister of sindh under the talpur dynasty restoration works were undertaken on the fort particularly on the sann gate complex the fortification wall extending south including the mosque and the small meeri fort or palace within the main fort these were undertaken by the archaeology department of pakistan the department of culture of sindh and the dadu district administration following allegations of poor construction and favoritism in award of contracts an enquiry was instituted in 2005 the enquiry commissions report indicated that the restoration works were poorly done with cement and new stone work without conforming to the venice charter for the conservation and restoration of monuments and sites and recommended stoppage of further work on the fort based on this report further restoration work

imprisoned by muhammad ziaulhaqs military government and then selfexiled to britain in 1984 she returned in 1986 and—influenced by thatcherite economics—transformed the ppps platform from a socialist to a liberal one before leading it to victory in the 1988 election as prime minister her attempts at reform were stifled by conservative and islamist forces including president ghulam ishaq khan and the powerful military her administration was accused of corruption and nepotism and dismissed by khan in 1990 intelligence services rigged that years election to ensure a victory for the conservative islamic democratic alliance iji at which point bhutto became leader of the opposition after the iji government of prime minister nawaz sharif was also dismissed on corruption charges bhutto led the ppp to victory in the 1993 elections in her second term she oversaw economic privatisation and attempts to advance womens rights her government was damaged by several controversies including the

pakistani taliban and rogue elements of the intelligence services was widely suspected she was buried at her family mausoleum in garhi khuda baksh bhutto was a controversial figure who remains divisive she was often criticised as being politically inexperienced was accused of being corrupt and faced much opposition from pakistans islamist lobby for her secularist and modernising agenda in the early years of her career she was nevertheless domestically popular and also attracted support from western nations for whom she was a champion of democracy posthumously she came to be regarded as an icon for womens rights due to her political success in a maledominated society bhutto was born at pintos nursing home on 21 june 1953 in karachi sindh pakistan her father was the politician zulfikar ali bhutto and her mother was begum nusrat ispahani the latter was born in isfahan persia now iran to a wealthy persian merchant family of partial kurdish descent zulfikar was the son of shah nawaz bhutto a prominent politician who had served as prime minister of the junagadh state the bhuttos were aristocratic wealthy landlords from sindh part of the waderos or landed gentry they were shia muslims benazir in her autobiography daughter of the east said the diaries of one of our ancestors giving the family details were washed away in a great flood in my greatgrandfathers time but as children we were told we were either descended from the rajputsor from the arabs who entered india through our home province of sindh in ad 712 some say that benazir bhutto is descended from the arains a muslim tribe of punjab who have a subclan called bhutta and they also claim to be descended from the arabs who entered india in ad 712 while others say that benazir is descended from the rajputs the couple had married in september 1951 and benazir was their first child she was given the name of an aunt who had died young the bhuttos three younger children were murtaza born 1954 sanam 1957 and shahnawaz 1958 when the elderly shah nawaz died in 1957 zulfikar inherited the familys land holdings making him extremely wealthy benazirs first language was english as a child she spoke urdu less frequently although she was fluent and barely spoke the local sindhi language her mother taught her some persian as a child benazir initially attended the lady jennings nursery school in karachi she was then sent to the convent of jesus and mary in karachi and from there to the jesus and mary convent a boarding school in murree murree is near the border with india and during the indopakistani war of 1965 bhutto and the other pupils underwent airraid practices taking her exams in december 1968 bhutto passed her olevels with high grades throughout her youth bhutto idolised her father and he in turn encouraged her educational development in contravention of traditional approaches to women then pervasive in pakistan relations between her parents were however strained during her childhood zulfikar embarked on extramarital affairs with other women and when nusrat objected he had her thrown out of their house she moved to iran but after zulfikar prevented her children from joining her there she returned to pakistan six months later settling in karachi throughout her life bhutto never publicly acknowledged this internal family discord when bhutto was five her father became the cabinet minister for energy and when she was nine he became the countrys foreign minister from an early age she was exposed to foreign diplomats and figures who were visiting her father among them zhou enlai henry kissinger and hubert humphrey when she was thirteen he resigned from the government and a year later established his own political party the pakistan peoples party ppp the ppp used the motto islam is our faith democracy is our policy socialism is our economy all power to the people it employed a populist strategy to attract votes promising roti kapra aur makan bread clothes and housing for every pakistani and insisting that the disputed territory of kashmir would be transferred from indian to pakistani control benazir immediately joined amid riots against the government of president ayub khan in 1968 zulfikar was arrested and imprisoned for three months during which he wrote to benazir to encourage her studies from 1969 to 1973 bhutto studied for an undergraduate degree at radcliffe college harvard university she started when she was sixteen which was younger than normal but zulfikar had pulled strings to allow her premature admittance zulfikar asked his friend john kenneth galbraith an economics professor at harvard who had formerly been a us ambassador to india to be her local guardian through him bhutto met his son peter galbraith who became a lifelong friend murtaza joined bhutto at harvard a year later bhutto found it difficult adjusting to life in the united states a fellow student said she cried most of her first semester although bhutto later called her time at harvard four of the happiest years of my life she became a campus tour guide with the crimson key society and the social secretary of her dormitory eliot house  she involved herself in campaigns against american involvement in the vietnam war joining a moratorium day protest on boston common she encountered activists involved in second wave feminism although was sceptical of some of the views expressed within the movement at harvard bhutto majored in comparative government and graduated cum laude with a bachelor of arts in 1973 in 1971 while she was at harvard zulfikar invited her to join him in new york city where he was involved in a united nations security council meeting on that years indopakistani war in december 1971 zulfikar assumed the presidency of pakistan the first democratically elected leader after 13 years of military rule in 1972 benazir accompanied her father to the indiapakistan summit in simla as a replacement for her mother who was ill there she was introduced to the indian prime minister indira gandhi while in simla she attracted much attention from both local and national indian press the first time she received such notice she attributed this to the fact that—in her words—she symbolized a new generation i had never been an indian i had been born in independent pakistan i was free of the complexes and prejudices which had torn indians and pakistanis apart in the bloody trauma of partition in 1974 she was flown to lahore to accompany her father at the organisation of islamic cooperations summit here she met a number of the assembled senior muslim world leaders who included libyas muammar gaddafi egypts anwar sadat syrias hafez alassad saudi arabias faisal and jordans hussein in autumn 1973 bhutto relocated to the united kingdom and began studying for a second undergraduate degree in philosophy politics and economics at lady margaret hall university of oxford after three years she received a secondclass degree at her fathers insistence she remained in oxford to study for a oneyear postgraduate degree reading international law and diplomacy at this point she attended st catherines college oxford one of her fellow students at oxford stated that there she epitomized the classic spoilt rich girl from a third world country she nevertheless made friends who later described her as a humorous and intellectually curious individual in 1977 she was elected president of the oxford union debating society the first asian woman to hold that post after her threemonth term was up she was succeeded by her close friend victoria schofield bhutto was also active in the local conservative association and it is through this connection that she is widely believed to have introduced future british prime minister theresa may to her future husband philip may\\ndespite the ongoing tensions between pakistan and india she interacted socially with indian students and while at oxford also made proposals of marriage to two fellow pakistani students but was rebuffed on both occasions bhutto biographer brooke allen thought that her time at oxford was almost certainly the happiest most carefree time of her life at oxford she led a campaign calling for the university to give her father an honorary degree she gained the support of her fathers old tutor the historian hugh trevor roper bhuttos campaign was opposed by counterprotests who believed that her fathers supposed involvement in the persecution of sheikh mujibur rahman and atrocities during the bangladesh liberation war made him unsuitable ultimately the university declined to award the honorary degree in later years bhutto acknowledged that at this time she had been ignorant of the pakistani armys complicity in the atrocities in bangladesh although always maintained that her father was blameless on the issue after her oxford education she returned to pakistan in june 1977 where she was scheduled to work at the prime ministers office and the interprovincial council of common interests during the rest of the summer intent on a career in the pakistani foreign service she was scheduled to take the services entrance exams later in the year other women on the subcontinent had picked up the political banners of their husbands brothers and fathers before me the legacies of political families passing down through the women had become a south asian tradition indira gandhi in india sirimavo bandaranaike in sri lanka fatima jinnah and my own mother in pakistan i just never thought it would happen to me — bhutto on the impact of her father in july 1977 zulfikar bhutto—who had just been reelected in a general election—was overthrown in a military coup operation fair play led by muhammad ziaulhaq the chief of army staff both zulfikar and benazir believed that zias coup had been assisted by the us central intelligence agency cia zulfikar claimed that in a 1975 meeting us diplomat henry kissinger had told him that the us would make a horrible example of him if he did not terminate pakistans efforts to build a nuclear bomb now in control of the country zia suspended the constitution and initiated a regime that combined military rule with social programs designed to further the islamisation of pakistani society according to islamic fundamentalist principles socialists intellectuals and journalists were arrested zulfikar too was arrested initially for less than a month after a crowd of over one million people greeted zulfikars release in karachi and demonstrations were held in support of the ousted president zia decided to eliminate him permanently in september zulfikar was rearrested and charged with the 1974 murder of muhammad ahmed khan kasuri the father of ahmed raza kasuri a vocal critic of zulfikars government after the coup bhuttos brothers were sent abroad to canvass international support for their father bhutto and her mother remained in pakistan although they were repeatedly detained for short periods when she was able bhutto visited her father in prison she and her mother put out a book about their father and encouraged ppp supporters to demonstrate in support of him she also assisted in the preparation of his defence case which was put before first the lahore high court which sentenced him to death and then the supreme court which upheld that decision former us attorney general ramsey clark attended the trial relating that it was a kangaroo court and that zulfikar did not receive a fair trial just before his execution zulfikar urged his wife and daughter to leave pakistan but they refused he was executed by hanging in april 1979 benazir and nusrat were then imprisoned for six months before being released and placed under house arrest for a further six months the two women were only fully released in april 1980 after the coup zulfikar had appointed his wife cochair of the ppp while in october 1977 benazir was appointed to the ppps central committee after zulfikars death benazir replaced his role in the party becoming its coleader in february 1981 she formally established the movement for the restoration of democracy mrd a group that brought together the ppp with other political parties in the country the pakistan muslim league pakistan democratic party mazdoor kisan party national awami party quomi mahazeazadi jamiatiulemaiislam and the tahrikiistiqlal the mrd called for a fourpoint program an end to martial law the restoration of the 1973 constitution parliamentary elections and the transfer of political power from the military to the elected representativescitation needed there was nevertheless much mutual suspicion among the parties in the mrd with bhutto having reluctantly allowed groups that firmly opposed her fathers government to join from abroad her brothers murtaza and shahnawaz turned to paramilitary action founding the al zulfikar group which trained its members to carry out acts of assassination and sabotage to oust zias military government after al zulfikar orchestrated the 1981 pakistan international airlines hijacking the government used this as the pretext for rearresting bhutto and her mother in march bhutto disapproved of the hijacking believing that it strengthened zias hand that she was punished for it may have exacerbated tensions with her brothers in july 1981 nusrat was released so that she could seek medical treatment for cancer abroad but bhutto was not she was kept for a time in karachi before being moved to sukkur prison and then back again to karachi during much of this period she was held in solitary confinement and experienced a range of health problems including hair loss gynaecological issues and anorexia in december she was moved into house arrest where she would remain for two years in the united states—a key ally of zias regime—peter galbraith helped rally support for bhutto including from the politicians claiborne pell and james buckley when zia visited washington dc in december 1982 they raised the issue of bhuttos imprisonment with him as international pressure mounted the pakistani government agreed to release her placing her on a flight to geneva in january 1984 from geneva bhutto proceeded to the united kingdom undergoing surgery on her mastoid before renting a flat in londons barbican estate there she socialised with friends going shopping hosting dinner parties and visiting the cinema one friend said that after her time in prison she remained in a mildly traumatized state jumping at sudden noise and worrying about who might be spying on her in march bhutto visited new york city and washington dc where she met with media figures and middleranking government officials but was kept at bay by the administration of president ronald reagan over the coming few years bhutto made several additional visits to the united states spoke to the european parliament in strasbourg visited the soviet union and undertook the umrah pilgrimage to mecca while in exile benazir became a rallying point for the ppp her flat became the unofficial headquarters of its members in exile these volunteers devoted themselves to raising international awareness of the political prisoners being held by zias regime although she was the partys acting chairperson many of its elder members were unhappy with this situation believing her insufficiently committed to socialism and fearing that the party would become nothing more than a bhutto family fiefdom murtaza believed that it was he and not benazir who was their fathers designated political heir as evidence he cited that he had been asked to manage his fathers larkana constituency in the 1977 general election bhutto biographer shyam bhatia thought that this was probably zulfikars intention as the latter would have recognised the significant impediments to a woman being elected leader in a conservative islamic society like pakistan benazir nevertheless maintained that her father had always wanted her to become a politician in july 1985 shahnawaz died under unexplained circumstances in the french city of cannes bhutto varyingly claimed that shahnawaz had been murdered by his wife raehana or had been killed on the orders of zia zias government allowed her to bring her brothers body to pakistan in august where it could be interred in the family cemetery at larkana shortly after the burial she was arrested and detained under house arrest in karachi until november at which point she was released and returned to europe in december 1985 martial law was lifted in pakistan and bhutto decided to return home she arrived at lahore airport in april 1986 where she was greeted by a large crowd an estimated two million people came to see her speak at iqbal park where she rallied against zias regime she then visited sindh punjab and balochistan speaking to further crowds and reestablished links with the mrd taking part in a prodemocracy rally on independence day on 14 august following the rally she was again arrested and detained for several weeks in landhi jail back in pakistan she agreed to an arranged marriage her mother selected asif ali zardari as a suitable husband he was from a landowning family and his father had obtained additional wealth through the construction and cinema industries the marriage ceremony took place in the clifton palace gardens at karachi in december 1987 the event was billed as the peoples wedding serving as a de facto political rally with a subsequent party in a lyari stadium being attended by 200000 people there some fired kalashnikovs into the air in celebration accidentally resulting in one death and multiple injuries bhutto would have been aware that being married gave her an image of respectability which would improve her chances of being elected she kept the bhutto family name rather than taking that of her new husband after the wedding she soon became pregnant and gave birth to her first son bilawal in may 1988 zia dissolved the assemblies and called a november election he had not wanted bhutto to win and his choice of date may have been deliberately chosen to coincide with the date when bhutto was projected to give birth thus hindering her ability to campaign he also sought to hinder her chances by declaring that the election would be held on a nonparty basis with candidates standing as individuals rather than as representatives of a political party bhutto and the ppp launched a legal challenge against this latter stipulation in august zia suddenly died when his aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff from bahawalpur airport a joint us–pakistani investigation was unable to ascertain the cause of the crash although sabotage was widely suspected with the soviets americans indians and israelis all presented as potential culprits bhutto privately attributed it to an act of god after zias death the supreme court announced that the election should take place on a party basis rather than the nonparty basis that zia had desired bhutto insisted that the ppp campaign separately from the mrd and dropped its socialist platform in favour of economic thatcherism and a commitment to the free market amid predictions that the ppp would win it received 18000 prospective candidates many offering the party money for their selection this influx of new members and candidates caused upset among many established members who felt that bhutto was deserting them in the buildup to the election there was a great sense of hope among liberal sectors of pakistani society however islamic fundamentalists said it was unislamic for the country to have a female leader their propaganda foregrounded what they presented as her unislamic behaviour including a photo of her dancing in a parisian nightclub zia loyalists and islamic fundamentalists united to form a new political party islami jamhoori ittehad iji which was funded by the interservices intelligence isi the isi also engaged in vote rigging in an attempt to secure an iji victory\\ndespite these difficulties bhutto led the ppp to victory in the election taking 93 of the 205 contested seats the iji took only 54 seats although the party secured control of punjab the countrys largest and most powerful province this meant that the ppp had the largest number of seats although not a clear majority both the ppp and iji courted independent mps hoping to woo them to their side and unsuccessful attempts were also made by the countrys rightwing forces to convince some of the elected ppp parliamentarians to switch allegiance to the iji the people of pakistan had rejected bigotry and prejudice in electing a woman prime minister it was an enormous honor and an equally enormous responsibility i had not asked for this role i had not asked for this mantle but the forces of destiny and the forces of history had thrust me forward and i felt privileged and awed — bhutto on becoming prime minister in her autobiography president ghulam ishaq khan was constitutionally obliged to invite bhutto to form the next government but was reticent to do so under growing pressure—including from the us a key ally—he reluctantly did so two weeks after the election to build her government bhutto formed a coalition with the muttahida qaumi movement mqm party which had 13 seats in parliament an action that upset the sindhi nationalist faction within her party she was sworn in as the prime minister of pakistan on 2 december 1988 bhutto became the first female prime minister in a muslimmajority country as well as pakistans second nationally elected prime minister at 35 years old she was the youngest elected leader in the islamic world the worlds youngest prime minister and the youngest female prime minister ever elected  after her election party workers were encouraged to refer to her as mohtarma respected lady there was hope among many observers that her premiership would mark a new era of multiparty democracy growing gender equality and better relations with india she personally stated that her electoral victory was the tipping point in the debate raging in the muslim world on the role of women in islam in 1988 bhutto published her autobiography subtitled daughter of the east in its british edition and daughter of destiny in the united states it was written with the assistance of an american ghost writer bhutto biographer brooke allen stating that it was preeminently a political performance written for a western audience with the intent of seducing western opinion and opinionmakers as well as whitewashing her fathers regime bhuttos autobiography contained several factual falsifications she wished to present herself as a groundbreaker when it came to gender issues and thus presented her mother nusrat as being far more conservative than she really was for instance falsely claiming that nusrat had urged her to wear the burqa when she had reached adolescence bhuttos first cabinet was the largest in pakistans history she appointed herself as the new treasury minister with her mother as a senior minister without portfolio and her fatherinlaw as chairman of the parliamentary public accounts committee quashing hopes that her administration would depart from the entrenched systems of cronyism in the country most of those in the administration had little political experience various members of the ppp old guard including mumtaz ali bhutto left the party in frustration at the procapitalist direction she had taken following her election there remained significant mistrust between bhutto and the rightwing military administration many senior military figures viewed her like her father as a threat to their dominant role in pakistans political arena the countrys three most powerful figures—the army chief aslam beg the isi chief hamid gul and president khan—all had contempt for her family this opposition was substantial and contributed to bhuttos inability to pass any major legislation during her first term in office however she had some successes with initiatives to encourage the development of civil society she ensured the release of a number of political prisoners detained under the zia government and lifted the ban on trade unions and student associations she removed many of the constraints imposed on nongovernmental organisations and introduced measures to lift the media censorship introduced by zias military administrations she entrusted shamsul hasan with dismantling the national press trust a conglomerate of over 15 newspapers but president khan delayed signing the documents and thus the trust would only be broken up during her second premiership among the problems facing pakistan when bhutto took the premiership was soaring employment and high unemployment the pakistani government was bankrupt with zia having borrowed at highinterest rates to pay government wages many of the policy promises she had made in her election campaign were not delivered because the pakistani state was unable to finance them she had claimed that a million new homes would be built each year and that universal free education and healthcare would be introduced none of which was economically feasible for her government to deliver the country also faced a growing problem with the illegal narcotics trade with pakistan being among the worlds largest heroin exporters and the drugs use rapidly increasing domestically bhutto pledged that she would take tough action on the powerful drug barons bhutto often argued with beg gul and khan over her desired policies and—according to allen—won some battles but ultimately lost the war against them bhutto succeeded in getting khans approval to change two of the countrys four provincial governors she appointed general tikka khan one of the few senior military officers who were loyal to her as the governor of punjab she sought to replace the chair of the joint chiefs of staff iftikhar ahmed sirohey but president khan refused to permit this bhutto disliked khans hostile attitude toward her but he had the backing of the military in the presidential election bhutto initially proposed malik qasim who had been involved in the mrd as the ppps nominee but the military refused to accept this bhutto relented and agreed that khan could be nominated as the ppps presidential candidate bhutto also wanted to replace mahbub ul haq as a finance minister but again the military opposed her compromising she accepted ul haqs continued role as finance minister but appointed wasim jafri as her financial advisor beg made it clear to bhutto that the military would not tolerate her interference in their control of the defence and foreign affairs at the time 60 of the countrys population lived in punjab province which was under the control of zias protégé nawaz sharif as provincial chief minister both sharif and bhutto attempted to remove the other from power with bhutto accusing sharif of having rigged the election to become chief minister sharif benefited from growing punjabi chauvinism toward the countrys sindhi minority as well as a perception that bhutto—a sindhi—was attacking the punjab although bhutto had long supported greater autonomy for pakistans provinces she opposed it in the case of the punjab sharifs punjabi authority refused to accept the federal officials whom bhutto posted there relations between bhutto and pakistans civil service also deteriorated causing paralysis of many state affairs bhutto spoke of it as zias bureaucracy and her perceived antipunjabi stance impacted many civil servants of whom 80 were punjabi in april 1989 opposition parties organised a parliamentary noconfidence vote in bhuttos leadership but it was defeated by 12 votes bhutto claimed that many national assembly voters had been bribed to vote against her with 10\\xa0million having been supplied for this by a saudi salafi cleric osama bin laden who sought to overthrow her government and replace it with an islamic theocracy her conservative critics continued to claim it was unislamic for a woman to govern and unsuccessfully tried to have pakistan suspended from the international organisation of islamic cooperation on this basis during her first premiership bhutto went on a number of foreign trips enhancing her image as the first female prime minister in the islamic world in these she sought to attract foreign investment and aid for pakistan she also made efforts to cultivate good relationships with the leaders of islamic countries who also had good relationships with her father including libyas gaddafi abu dhabis sheikh zayed and the saudi royal family in 1989 she attended the commonwealth heads of government meeting in kuala lumpur where pakistan was readmitted to the commonwealth of nations in january 1989 she made a second pilgrimage to mecca and in june visited the us to address both houses of congress and giving the commencement speech at harvard as premier bhutto was reluctant to challenge the isis support for the islamist mujahideen forces in afghanistan which were then engaged in a civil war against the countrys marxist–leninist government the us was funneling money to these mujahedeen through pakistan although preferred to deal directly with beg gul and ishaq khan rather than through bhutto in april 1989 gul led an invasion of afghanistan with the purpose of seizing jalalabad which was then to be formed into a capital from which the countrys antisoviet islamistdominated opposition forces could operate when the operation failed and the pakistanis were driven out by the afghan army gul blamed bhuttos administration for the failure claiming that someone in her entourage had leaked details of the mission to the afghan government gul was too powerful for bhutto to force him into retirement but in may 1989 she transferred him from the isi to another section of the military placing a more trusted military figure in his role bhutto initially attempted to improve relations with neighbouring india withdrawing zias offer of a nowar pact and announcing the 1972 simla agreement as the basis of future relations she invited indian prime minister rajiv gandhi and his wife sonia as her guests for a threeday visit in islamabad following the south asian association for regional cooperation summit rajiv returned on a bilateral visit six months later she pleased him by revoking zias offer of the nishanepakistan award to the former indian leader morarji desai the two countries agreed to reduce their military levels along the border and agreed not to attack their respective nuclear installations bhutto claimed that she terminated support for sikh separatists active in india something which zia had encouraged to destabilise indian control in their half of the punjab this warming of relations angered many domestic islamist and conservative forces they alleged that she and gandhi were having a sexual relationship said that she was secretly an indian agent and also placed renewed emphasis on the fact that bhuttos paternal grandmother had been born to a hindu family the people of kashmir do not fear death because they are muslims the kashmiris have the blood of the mujahids and ghazis the kashmiris have the blood of muhajadeens because kashmiris are the heirs of prophet mohammed hazrat ali and hazrat omarand the brave women of kashmir they know how to fight and also to live and when they live they do so with dignity from every village only one voice will emerge freedom from every school only one voice will emerge freedom every child will shout freedom freedom freedom — bhuttos speech rallying kashmiri militants to fight for independence from india 1990 after accusations of being too conciliatory towards india bhutto took a harder line against them particularly on the kashmir conflict amid growing kashmiri protests against indian rule in interviews bhutto expressed support for the kashmiri muslim community she called on the united nations to oversee the kashmir plebiscite originally promised in 1948 bhutto visited a training camp for proindependence kashmiris on the pakistani side of the border and pledged 5 million for their cause she followed this with further statements in support of the proindependence groups in one speech she incited kashmiri muslims to rise up against their administration later in a 1993 interview bhutto stated that supporting proxy wars in punjab and kashmir was the one right thing undertaken by zia presenting these in part as revenge for indias role in the humiliating loss of bangladesh in 1990 major general pervez musharraf proposed a military invasion of kargil as part of an attempt to annex kashmir bhutto refused to back the plan believing that the international condemnation would be severe\\nwith both armies mobilizing on either side of the border there were growing fears that tensions over kashmir could result in a nuclear war between pakistan and india the us sent special envoy robert gates to the region to dissuade the pakistanis from going to war he could not meet bhutto—who was in yemen as part of a tour of the gulf states—but met with president khan informing him that the us would not support pakistani military action he convinced pakistan to step back from hostilities and to disband the kashmiri training camps in its territory after bhutto became prime minister president khan and the military were reluctant to tell her about pakistans nuclear program and it remains unknown how much bhutto knew about the issue during her first term in office she later related that to find out more she contacted key scientists in the program such as a q khan herself bypassing the president and military hierarchy on her trip to the united states she told congress that we do not possess nor do we intend to make a nuclear device while in washington dc she met with cia director william webster who showed her a mockup of the pakistani nuclear weapon and stated his opinion that research the project it had reached a crescendo in the final years of zias government williams revelations came as a shock to bhutto who was unaware of how advanced  pakistans nuclear development had become the united states wanted to prevent pakistan from creating such a device and president george h w bush informed her that us military aid to the country would cease unless pakistan refrained from producing nuclear bomb cores the final step in creating the weapon between january and march 1989 she authorised cold tests of nuclear weaponry without fissionable material although this did not satisfy the military authorities in 1990 shortly before leaving office the american ambassador robert oakley informed her that information obtained by us satellites indicated that her commitment to not produce weaponsgrade uranium had been breached at the kahuta enrichment plant the isi organised operation midnight jackal through which they used bribery and intimidation to discourage national assembly members from voting with the ppp\\nby 1990 the revelation of midnight jackal lessened president khans influence in national politics government and the military in the 1980s ethnic violence had broken out in sindh province with most of those killed being mohajirs late in 1989 the mqm—whose party represented mohajir interests—left bhuttos coalition government the mqm then joined other voices in calling for a general strike to protest bhuttos government in may 1990 she ordered the army to restore peace in karachi and hyderabad within months of bhuttos election dissolution had set in among her liberal supporters her narrow majority in the national assembly had left her unable to reverse many of the islamist reforms that zia had introduced she did not repeal the hudood ordinances which remained in law until 2006 her opposition to legalised abortion frustrated many pakistani feminists throughout her first term bhutto was criticised for being indecisive and unable to maintain control there had been anger that her husband had been allowed to attend cabinet meetings despite not being a member of the government he was also accused of receiving kickbacks and gained the nickname mr ten percent the isi had extensively spied upon bhutto and her husband throughout her period in office president khan privately paid plaintiffs to file corruption suits against bhuttos husband while the investigations into his corruption were therefore politically motivated there also was significant evidence of his guilt in this regard in 1990 bhutto gave birth to her first daughter bakhtawar tales of corruption in publicsector industries began to surface which undermined the credibility of bhutto the unemployment and labour strikes began to take place which halted and jammed the economic wheel of the country and bhutto was unable to solve these issues due to the cold war with the president in august 1990 khan dismissed bhuttos government under the eighth amendment of the constitution he claimed that this was necessary owing to her governments corruption and inability to maintain law and order a caretaker government under the control of former ppp member ghulam mustafa jatoi was sworn in with khan declaring a state of national emergency khan called for new elections in the meantime bhutto and her husband were forbidden to leave pakistan although they purchased an apartment in queens gate in the south kensington area of london in october zardari was arrested on charges of extortion according to the allegations he had attached a remotecontrol bomb to the leg of a businessman and forced the latter to enter a bank and withdraw money he was convicted and remained in prison for three years in the 1990 general election the ppp only secured 45 of the 217 seats the iji under the leadership of nawaz sharif won a majority in the parliament and sharif became prime minister bhutto became the leader of the opposition from this position she attacked sharifs every policy highlighting his governments failings in dealing with pakistans problems of poverty unemployment and lack of healthcare although not also discussing her own administrations failures on those same issues to journalists she remained unrepentant about her period in office insisting that she had made no mistakes she subsequently also accused sharif of backing the salafi jihadist militant group alqaeda established by bin laden following the assassination of rajiv gandhi in may 1991 bhutto visited india to attend his funeral as dissatisfaction with sharifs government grew the ppp began to restore the support it had lost during bhuttos premiership encouraging public protests in november 1992 she organised a 10mile march from rawalpindi to islamabad in protest at the iji government sharif ordered her to be placed under house arrest to prevent her instigating any uprisings despite an economic recovery in late 1993 the iji government faced public unease about the direction of the country and industrialisation that revolved around and centered only in punjab province amid protest and civil disorder in sindh province following the imposition of operation cleanup the ida government lost control of the province the peoples party attacked the ida governments record on unemployment and industrial racism sharif had attempted to reduce the presidents powers relations between sharif and president khan also soured and the prime minister came under pressure to resign from the armed forces with growing tensions between him and president khan in april 1993 the latter used the eighth amendment to dismiss sharif as prime minister citing corruption and misadministration an agreement was reached whereby both sharif and khan would step down the military formed an interim government and called a general election for october 1993\\ntheir policies were very similar but a clash of personalities occurred with both parties making many promises but not explaining how they were going to pay for them bhutto promised price supports for agriculture pledged a partnership between government and business and campaigned strongly for the female vote in february 1993 bhutto gave birth to her daughter asifa that year she also declared herself chair of the ppp for life this move reflected the lack of internal democracy within the party which was increasingly referred to as the bhutto family party bfp during her campaign for the 1993 general election the salafi jihadist ramzi yousef unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate her twice yousef went on to play a role in the 1993 world trade center bombing in the us in the october 1993 general election the ppp won the most seats although it fell short of an outright majority with 86 seats sharifs new party the pakistan muslim league nawaz came second with 73 seats the ppp performed extremely well in bhuttos native province sindh and rural punjab while the pmln was strongest in industrial punjab and the largest cities such as karachi lahore and rawalpindi bhutto was again prime minister but this time had a weaker parliamentary mandate than she had had in 1988 she was officially sworn in on 19 october 1993 realising the threat to her premiership posed by an unsympathetic president bhutto ensured that a ppp member farooq leghari was nominated and duly elected to the presidency in november zardari was freed from prison after bhutto returned to office in 1993 during her second term bhutto appointed both her husband and mother to her cabinet the former was appointed investment minister chief of the intelligence bureau directorgeneral of the federal investigation agency and chair of the new environment protection council she gave him a monopoly on the countrys gold imports a post that earned him 10\\xa0million which he deposited in an indian bank allen suggested that measures like these reflected how bhutto had given up on all her previous ideals and simply caved into the culture of corruption—indeed excelled in it as she had excelled in so many other areas john burns a journalist from the new york times investigated the business transactions of bhutto and his wife exposing the scale of their corruption by 1996 their takings through these various deals were estimated at 15\\xa0billion a subsequent inquiry by pakistans accountability bureau found that in that year bhutto her husband and her mother only declared assets totaling 12\\xa0million leaving out the extensive foreign accounts and properties that they possessed despite their significant earnings the couple did not pay the amount of tax owed between 1993 and 1994 bhutto paid no income tax at all in 1996 transparency international ranked pakistan as the worlds second most corrupt country bhutto ordered the construction of a new residence in islamabad it covered 110 acres of ground and cost 50\\xa0million to construct in 1993 bhutto declared that her family burial ground would be converted into an official mausoleum and would undergo significant expansion she dropped the first architect she employed to do the job after deciding that she wanted a more islamic design she replaced him with waqar akbar rizvi instructing him to visit the tombs of mustafa kemal atatürk and ruhollah khomeini for inspiration in 1995 zardari purchased a fifteenbedroom country house at rockwood in surrey southern england to hide evidence of ownership he obtained the property through companies based in the isle of man she spent much of her second term abroad making 24 foreign trips during its first twelve months the ppp government made dramatic reforms in womens rights i appointed several women to my cabinet and established a ministry of womens development we created womens studies programs in universities we established a womens development bank to give credit only to enterprising women and we legalized and encouraged womens participation in international sports which had been banned in the years of the zia military dictatorship it was a solid start in a society where islam had been exploited to repress the position of women in society for a bitter generation — bhutto on the womens rights advances of her government seeking to advance womens rights in her second term bhutto signed pakistan to the international convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women she was also a founding member of the council of women world leaders a group established in 1996 bhutto oversaw the creation of a womens division in the government headed by a senior female civil servant as well as a womens bank she opened a series of allfemale police stations staffed with female officers to make women feel safer in coming forward to report crimes she established family courts with female judges to deal with child custody and family issues and in 1994–95 the first women judges were appointed to the supreme courts of peshawar and sindh the fundamentalist islamic laws introduced to restrict womens rights under zia nevertheless remained in place her failure to remove the hudood ordinances brought criticism from liberal circles and damaged her relations with womens and human rights groups bhutto stated that once back in the office she asked for reasons why the kahuta enrichment plant had broken her command by producing weaponsgrade uranium and implemented a new system of security at the plant to provide greater oversight of the facilitys scientists both the military and isi however supported the development of material that could produce viable nuclear weaponry india had developed the agni missile a system which would allow the country to strike all of pakistans major cities and as a counter many in the pakistani administration believed that they needed an equivalent launch pad system for their nuclear warheads they decided to make a deal with the north korean government exchanging information about enrichment for missile technology bhutto later claimed that on her 1993 visit to north korea she secretly carried a computer cd containing nuclear data although she subsequently retracted this claim bhutto also made a state visit to the us in 1995 where she convinced congress to repeal sanctions that they had imposed on pakistan over its nuclear weapons programme in 1990 in september 1996 the taliban secured power in afghanistan bhuttos government was one of only three countries to recognize it as the legitimate afghan government a move that further distanced it from its western allies the talibans rise coincided with a broader growth in opposition to bhutto from salafi islamist groups increasingly there were salafist protests against bhutto in countries other than pakistan during a trip to london bhutto faced islamist protests outside the dorchester hotel where she was staying speaking to uk prime minister john major she highlighted this protest as evidence for the growth of salafi ideology in britain commenting that it would generate problems for western countries in future bhutto was prime minister at a time of great racial tension in pakistan ethnic violence had broken out in sindh as muhajir—mobilised by the mqm—rioted in protest at what they saw as their poor treatment abductions bombings and murders became increasingly common in karachi to deal with the unrest bhutto permitted her interior minister naseerullah babar to launch operation blue fox a violent crackdown on the mqm by the time that the operation was officially completed the government announced that 3000 had been killed in karachi although the number may have been far larger an amnesty international report commented that while bhutto had declared that her government would end human rights abuses the use of torture rape and extrajudicial killings remained common in pakistani prisons sharif had been a proponent of laissez faire economics and his government had promoted privatisation during her second term bhutto also became increasingly open about her support for such an economic policy pursuing broadly similar approaches to those of sharif her second term therefore witnessed a liberal approach to economics and the privatisation of industrial plants pakistan saw a record 20 billion of foreign investment during this term largely in the power industry the country also entered the list of the worlds top ten developing capital markets\\nthere were far fewer public hopes regarding the second bhutto premiership than there had been for the first the countrys financial situation left no funds for her to pursue the desired social programs 70 of national revenues went on paying off the national debt while much of the other 30 went on the military which would not tolerate cuts to its budget the 1990s had seen severe economic problems for pakistan the countrys economic growth had declined to between 3 and 4 poverty rose to 33 and the percentage of households living in absolute poverty doubled with rapidly growing inflation and higher taxes there was growing discontent over pakistans economic situation the announcement of the 1995 budget was met with strikes and demonstrations as many ppp members became increasingly dissatisfied with bhutto during the 1990s they referred to her brother mir murtaza still in exile as zulfikars true heir from syria murtaza campaigned as an independent candidate for larkana in the sindh legislative assembly election of 1993 bhutto did not want him to join the ppp fearing him as a potential challenger to her leadership of the party however his mother nusrat campaigned for him helping him win the election having won he flew back to pakistan in november to take up his new position around ninety criminal charges had been brought against him under zias regime so on arrival murtaza was arrested and held for eight months in solitary confinement suvorova suggested that bhutto had allowed this as a concession to those including president leghari and the sindhi chief minister syed abdullah ali shah who insisted that murtaza face criminal proceedings for his militant activities murtaza maintained that it was he rather than his sister who was the standardbearer for their fathers championing of the downtrodden he espoused a socialist platform different from his sisters and called for internal elections within the ppp which could have resulted in the removal of bhutto animosity grew between the two siblings in june 1994 murtaza was released on bail and at his subsequent trial he was acquitted of all charges in 1995 he established his own party the ppp shaheed bhutto the partys name implied that he was closer to the bhuttos familys shaheed than his sister whom he symbolically distanced from the family by referring to her as begum zardari murtaza focused much of his criticism on bhuttos husband zardari whom he blamed of being responsible for government corruption he hung a picture of zardari up in the guest toilet of his house as an act of disrespect to his brotherinlaw a rumour spread that in one incident murtaza invited zardari to his house only to have him pinned down by bodyguards and half his mustache forcibly shaved off nusrat continued to support murtaza damaging her relationship with bhutto mother and daughter increasingly criticised one another bhutto was so angry with her mothers actions that she ousted her as cochair of the ppp this angered nusrat who told the new york times shes talked a lot about democracy but shes become a little dictator on 20 september 1996 murtaza was ambushed by police near karachi they opened fire killing him and seven others all witnesses were taken into police custody where two of them died it was widely believed in pakistan that the killing had been ordered by a senior government figure murtazas supporters thought that bhutto and her husband were responsible when bhutto tried to attend her brothers funeral in larkana local murtaza supporters pelted her car with rocks at the funeral nusrat—who had the early stages of alzheimers disease—also blamed bhutto for her brothers death bhutto initially blamed the killing on a conspiracy against her family she suggested that president leghari had been involved in an act designed to destabilise her government she brought in scotland yard to investigate partly to quell rumors that she had ordered the killing although the case remained unsolved after murtazas death bhutto reestablished a relationship with her mother her approval poll rose by 38 after she appeared and said in a private television interview after the elections we are unhappy with the manner in which tampered electoral lists were provided in a majority of constituencies our voters were turned away the conservatives attracted voters from religious society mma whose support had collapsed in confidential official documents benazir bhutto had objected to the number of urdu speaking class in 1993 elections in the context that she had no urduspeaking sentiment in her circle and discrimination was continued even in her government her stance on these issues was perceived as part of rising public disclosure which altaf hussain called racism due to benazir bhuttos stubbornness and authoritative actions her political rivals gave her the nickname iron lady of pakistan no response was issued by bhutto but she soon associated with the term benazir bhutto expanded the authoritative rights of police combatant force and the provisional governments that tackled the local opposition aggressively bhutto through her internal security minister naseerullah babar intensified the internal security operations and steps gradually putting down the oppositions political rallies while she did not completely abandon the reconciliation policy in her own worlds benazir bhutto announced there was no basis for strikes  in view of the ongoing political process bhutto was an economist by profession therefore during her terms as prime minister she herself took charge of the ministry of finance bhutto sought to improve the countrys declining economy she disagreed with her fathers nationalisation and socialist economics soon after the collapse of the soviet union benazir attempted to privatise major industries that had been nationalised in the 1970s bhutto promised to end the nationalisation programme and to carry out the industrialisation programme by means other than state intervention however bhutto did not carry out the denationalisation program or liberalisation of the economy during her first government no nationalised units were privatised and few economic regulations were reviewed pakistan suffered a currency crisis when the government failed to arrest the 30 fall in the value of the pakistani rupee from ₨ 21 to ₨30 per us dollar soon economic progress became her top priority but her investment and industrialisation programs faced major setbacks due to conceptions formed by investors based upon her peoples party nationalisation program in the 1970s by the 1990s khan and bhuttos government had also ultimately lost the currency war with the indian rupee which beat the value of pakistan rupee for the first time in the 1970s bhuttos denationalisation program also suffered from many political setbacks as many of her government members were either directly or indirectly involved with the government corruption in major governmentowned industries and her appointed government members allegedly sabotaged her efforts to privatise the industries overall the living standard for people in pakistan declined as inflation and unemployment grew at an exponential rate particularly as un sanctions began to take effect during her first and second term the difference between rich and poor visibly increased and the middle class in particular were the ones who bore the brunt of the economic inequality according to a calculation completed by the federal bureau of statistics the standard of living for the rich improved while the standard of living for the poor declined benazir attributed this economic inequality to be a result of ongoing and continuous illegal bangladeshi immigration bhutto ordered a crackdown on and deportation of illegal bangladeshi immigrants her action strained and created tensions in bangladesh–pakistan relations as bangladesh prime minister khaleda zia refused to accept the deportees and reportedly sent two planeloads back to pakistan religious parties also criticised bhutto and dubbed the crackdown as antiislamic this operation backfired and had devastating effects on pakistans economy president khan saw this as a major economic failure despite khans permission granted to bhutto for the approval of her economic policies khan blamed bhutto for this extensive economic slowdown and her policy that failed to stop the illegal immigration khan attributed bhuttos government members corruption in governmentowned industries as the major sinkhole in pakistans economy that failed to compete with neighboring indias economy during her second term bhutto continued to follow former prime minister nawaz sharifs privatisation policies which she called a disciplined macroeconomics policy after the 1993 general elections the privatisation programme of stateowned banks and utilities accelerated more than ₨ 42\\xa0billion was raised from the sale of nationalised corporations and industries and another us20\\xa0billion from the foreign investment made the united states after 1993 the countrys national economy again entered in the second period of the stagflation and more roughly began bite the countrys financial resources and the financial capital bhuttos second government found it extremely difficult to counter the second era of stagflation with pressler amendment and the us financial and military embargo tightened its position after a year of study bhutto implemented and enforced the eighth plan to overcome the stagflation by creating a dependable and effective mechanism for accelerating economic and social progress but according to american ambassador to pakistan william milams bibliography bangladesh and pakistan flirting with failure in south asia the eighth plan which reflected the planned economy of the soviet union was doomed to meet with failure from the very beginning of 1994 as the policies were weak and incoherent on many occasions bhutto resisted to privatise globally competitive and billiondollarworth stateowned enterprises such as pakistan railways and pakistan steel mills instead the grip of nationalisation in those stateowned enterprises was tightened in order to secure the capital investment of these industries the process of privatisation of the nationalised industries was associated with the marked performance and improvement especially the terms of labour productivity a number of privatisation of industries such as gas water supply and sanitation and electricity general were natural monopolies for which the privatisation involved little competition furthermore benazir denied that privatisation of the pakistan railways would take place despite the calls made in pakistan and was said to have told planning commission chief naveed qamar railways privatisation will be the black hole of this government please never mention the railways to me againcitation needed bhutto always resisted privatisation of united bank limited pakistan ubl but its management sent the recommendation for the privatisation which dismayed the labour union the united group of employees management asked bhutto for the issue of the regulation sheet which she denied the holding of ubl in government control turned out to be a move that ended in disaster for bhuttos government majorgeneral pervez musharraf worked closely with bhutto and her government in formulating an israel strategy in 1993 bhutto ordered musharraf then directorgeneral of the pakistani armys directorategeneral for the military operation dgmo to join her state visit to the united states unusual and unconventional participation bhutto and musharraf chaired a secret meeting with israeli officials who traveled to the us especially for the meeting under bhuttos guidance musharraf intensified the isis liaison with israels mossad a final meeting took place in 1995 which musharraf also joined bhutto also strengthened relations with its most important partner communist china and repeatedly visited beijing for mutual trade and international political cooperation the two countries in 1995 benazir bhutto made another state visit to the united states and held talks with us president bill clinton bhutto urged him to revise the pressler amendment and launch a campaign against extremism she criticised us nonproliferation policy and demanded that the united states honor its contractual obligationclarification needed during her second term relations with indian prime minister p v narasimha rao further deteriorated like her father benazir bhutto used rhetoric to oppose india and campaign in the international community against the indian nuclear program on 1 may 1995 she used harsh language in her public warning to india that continuation of indian nuclear program would have terrible consequences india responded to this saying she was interfering in an internal matter of india and the indian army fired a rpg at the kahuta which further escalated events leading to fullfledged war when this news reached bhutto she responded by highalerting the air force strategic command it ordered heavily armed arrows griffins black panthers and the black spiders to begin air sorties and to patrol the indopakistan border on dayandnight regular missions all of these squadrons are part of the strategic command on 30 may india testfired a prithvi1 missile near the pakistan border which bhutto condemned she responded by deploying shaheeni missiles however they were not armed benazir bhutto permitted the paf to deploy the crotale missile defence and the anzamkiii near the indian border which escalated the conflict but effectively kept the indian army and the indian air force from launching any surprise attack in 1995 the isi reported to bhutto that narasimha rao had authorised nuclear tests and that they could be conducted at any minute benazir put the countrys nuclear arsenal programme on highalert made emergency preparations and ordered the pakistani armed forces to remain on highalert however the united states intervened indian operations for conducting the nuclear tests were called off and the japanese government attempted to mediate in 1996 benazir bhutto met with japanese officials and warned india about conducting nuclear tests she revealed for the first time that pakistan had achieved parity with india in its capacity to produce nuclear weapons and their delivery capability she told the indian press that pakistan cannot afford to negate the parity we maintain with india these statements represented a departure from pakistans previous policy of nuclear ambivalence bhutto issued a statement on the tests and told the international press that she condemned the indian nuclear tests if india conducts a nuclear test it would force her pakistan to  follow suit she said bhutto also ratcheted up her policy on indian kashmir rallying against india at an interparliamentary union meeting at the united nations bhutto who was accompanied by her speaker yousaf raza gillani upset and angered the indian delegation headed by prime minister atal bihari vajpayee with vehement criticism of india vajpayee responded saying it is pakistan which is flouting the united nations resolution by not withdrawing its forces from kashmir\\xa0 you people create problems every time you know the kashmiri people themselves acceded to india first the maharajah then the kashmiri parliament both decided to go with india during her second term benazir bhuttos relations with the pakistan armed forces took a different and probhutto approach when she carefully appointed general abdul waheed kakar as the chief of army staff general abdul waheed was an uptight strict and a professional officer with a view of westernised democracy benazir also appointed admiral saeed mohammad khan as chief of naval staff general abbas khattak as chief of air staff whilst air chief marshal farooq feroze khan was appointed chairman joint chiefs who was the first and to date only pakistani air officer to have reached to such 4 stars assignment benazir bhutto enjoyed strong relations with the pakistan armed forces and president who was handpicked by her did not question her authority she handpicked officers and promoted them based on their prodemocracy views while the president gave constitutional authorisation for their promotion the senior military leadership including jehangir karamat musharraf kayani ali kuli khan farooq feroze khan abbas khattak and fasih bokhari had strong westerndemocratic views and were generally close to bhutto as they had resisted nawaz sharifs conservatism unlike nawaz sharifs second democratic term benazir worked with the military on many issues where the military disagreement solving many problems relating directly to civilmilitary relations her tough and hardline policies on afghanistan kashmir and india which the military had backed benazir bhutto staunchly after the assassination was attempted benazir bhuttos civilian security team headed under rehman malik was disbanded by the pakistan army whose xcorps 111th psychological brigade— an army brigade tasked with countering the psychological warfare— took control of the security of benazir bhutto that directly reported to chief of army staff and the prime minister benazir bhutto ordered general abdul waheed kakar and the lieutenantgeneral javed ashraf qazi directorgeneral of isi to start a sting and manhunt operation to hunt down the ringmaster ramzi yousef after few arrests and intensive manhunt search the isi finally captured ramzi before he could flee the country in a matter of weeks ramzi was secretly extradited to the united states while the isi managed to kill or apprehend all the culprits behind the plot in 1995 she personally appointed general naseem rana as the directorgeneral of the isi who later commanded the pakistan armys assets in which came to known as pakistans secret war in afghanistan during this course general rana directly reported to the prime minister and led the intelligence operations after which were approved by benazir bhutto in 1995 benazir also appointed admiral mansurul haq as the chief of naval staff as the admiral had personal contacts with the benazirs family however it was the admirals largescale corruption sponsored by her husband asif zardari that shrunk the credibility of benazir bhutto by the end of 1996 that led to the end of her government after all relations between bhutto and leghari had declined after she suggested he had been involved in her brothers murder leghari sought the backing of the army chief karamat to move against her premiership leghari warned bhutto that he would dismiss her government unless she introduced measures to curtail corruption and deal with the economic crisis in response she gave up her role as minister of finances and dismissed most of her economic advisers in october 1996 she nevertheless maintained that the countrys economic problems were the fault of sharifs previous administration citing the eighth amendment of the constitution on 5 november leghari dismissed bhuttos government on the grounds of corruption and incompetence he added the suspicion that bhutto had been involved in her brothers death troops surrounded bhuttos residence while zardari tried to leave the country for dubai but was arrested and imprisoned charged with money laundering and involvement in murtazas murder he remained in prison until 2004 leghari installed a civilian caretaker government led by malik meraj khalid while announcing forthcoming elections for february 1997 \\nbhutto challenged the constitutionality of legharis decision taking the issue to the supreme court but they ruled in agreement with the president in january in a 6–1 ruling the supreme courts decision also resulted in the removal of all probhutto elements from the military in the ensuing election which took place in february 1997 sharif was reelected the ppp had secured only 18 seats in the national assembly some pakistani feminist groups had refused to back bhuttos reelection because despite her repeated promises she had not removed the hudud ordinances that zias administration had introduced newly reelected sharif moved quickly to curtail the powers of the presidency and judiciary he removed the constitutions eighth amendment which had been used by successive presidents to oust both bhutto and himself from office sharif also launched judicial proceedings against bhutto\\nin 1998 india tested its first nuclear weapon bhutto responded with an editorial for the los angeles times in which she argued that the international community should go further than imposing economic sanctions on india but should launch a preemptive bomb strike on indias nuclear facilities she called on sharif to retaliate with a series of pakistani military tests after sharifs government did so bhutto called for pakistan to sign the comprehensive nucleartestban treaty and arrive at a bilateral agreement on nuclear proliferation with india tensions between india and pakistan resulted in the kargil war of 1999 the conflict humiliated pakistan both militarily and politically and left the country with a very poor international standing bhutto observed the conflict from abroad describing it as pakistans biggest blunder in april 1999 the ehtesab bench of the lahore high court convicted bhutto in absentia giving her a five years prison sentence an 86\\xa0million fine and disqualifying her from public office the pakistani authorities unsuccessfully tried to secure her arrest and extradition through interpol bhutto claimed that this was politically motivated she was in london at the time of the judgment and rather than returning to pakistan she relocated to dubai she decided on dubai because zayed bin sultan al nahyan the president of the united arab emirates had been a longstanding friend of her family she brought her mother and three children to live there with her settling into a villa in the emirates hills given to her by the emirati government she claimed that were she to return to pakistan then she would be imprisoned and then murdered she remained in dubai for eight years for five of which her husband remained imprisoned in pakistan she remained head of the ppp\\nand spent much of her time in exile fighting the corruption charges that were being brought against her and her husband two years later a retrial was ordered after it was ascertained that undue political bias was exerted on the judges bhutto also campaigned for zardaris release from prison some of her close political advisers suggested that she abandon him for the sake of her political career but she refused while in dubai she also focused on raising her children and caring for her mother whose alzheimers disease had progressed to a severe stage in october 1999 the chair of the joint chiefs of staff pervez musharraf launched a military coup which ousted sharif from power bhutto called the coup disturbing and distressing but noted that it had got rid of sharif an unpopular despot who was hounding the press the judiciary the opposition the foreign investors she called on western countries to push for a return to electoral democracy in pakistan musharraf stated that both sharif and bhutto had misgoverned the country and had failed to allow internal democracy within their own parties pointing to bhuttos appointment as chair for life of the ppp something he compared to the old african dictators in april 2000 sharif was convicted of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment at the request of the saudi monarch sharif was released from prison after a year and exiled to saudi arabia he was also disqualified from holding public office in 2002 musharraf amended the constitution to ban anyone serving more than two terms as prime minister thus disqualifying both bhutto and sharif whom he called useless politicians musharraf also consolidated power around himself in june 2001 he appointed himself to the presidency holding this position alongside his positions as chief executive and chief of the army staff he talked about the need for a return to democracy and to respect human rights he was a secularist and repealed the hudood ordinances an achievement bhutto had been unable to make in an april 2002 referendum musharraf extended his presidential mandate for a further five years bhutto expressed concern that with mainstream politicians removed from pakistans political arena the vacuum would be filled by islamist extremists she was in dubai while the ppp contested the october 2002 general election it received the largest number of votes but only 63 seats in the national assembly musharraf agreed to release zardari in november 2004 as a symbol of good will following his release zardari travelled to new york for medical treatment bhutto flew to new york roughly every three weeks to visit him the couple did not officially acknowledge it but their relationship was essentially over figures in the ppp alleged that musharraf held a longstanding animosity towards bhutto and her family because under her father musharrafs father had been sacked from his position accused of involvement in a scam in june 1997 the pakistani government formally requested that the swiss government review bank accounts owned by bhutto and her husband in 1998 a swiss magistrate daniel devaud seized a safedeposit box containing a 190000 necklace that bhutto had purchased in londons bond street the previous year over the following six years he investigated how bhutto had obtained the money used to buy this item his investigations were followed by a bbc documentary team led by owen bennettjones devauds investigations revealed a range of corrupt deals that zardari had been involved with it was discovered that dassault a french aircraft manufacturer had agreed to pay zardari and another pakistani man 200\\xa0million to ensure he would facilitate a 4\\xa0billion sales of fighter jets it was also revealed that in both bhutto and zardari had taken approximately 15\\xa0million in exchange for awarding a customs contract to the swiss firms sgscotecna when she was prime minister devaud concluded that bhutto knew she was acting in a criminally reprehensible manner by abusing her role in order to obtain for herself and for her husband considerable sums in the interest of her family at the cost of the islamic republic of pakistan benazir bhutto was embroiled in a number of cases being pursued by nawaz sharifs government in 1997 she termed those cases as a part of sharifs plan to eliminate her from politics in an effort to challenge sharif governments ehtesab drive ms bhutto along with other ppp leaders visited the ehtesab commission islamabad where she handed over corruption references against then pm nawaz sharif and his brother shehbaz sharif to abdul jaleel director special enquiries at the ehtesab commission these references contained charges of corruptions against sharif family and saifurrehman who was a close aide of nawaz sharif ms bhutto gave full statements of facts of complaints in 1998 switzerland issued a request for the arrest of bhutto on suspicion of money laundering the geneva city court subsequently charged zardari in absentia with laundering money and taking bribes of 15 million from sgs and cotecna a swiss court ordered her to turn over 119\\xa0million to the pakistani state and to serve 180 days in prison 17 swiss bank accounts owned by the zardaribhutto family were frozen by the countrys government in 2004 a uk court ruled that rockwood estate in surrey—which zardari owned despite his repeated denials—should be sold and the proceeds given to the pakistani state who were the rightful owners zardari protested admitting that he owned the property and that he should receive the proceeds of its sale through a spokesman bhutto said that the charges against her represented a witch hunt and compared them to mccarthyism she expressed bemusement as to why many thought her spending was lavish i mean what is poor and what is rich if you mean am i rich by european standards do i have a billion dollars or even a hundred million dollars even half that no i do not but if you mean that im ordinary rich yes my father had three children studying at harvard as undergraduates at the same time but this wealth never meant anything to my brothers or me she maintained that the charges against her and her husband were purely political bhutto ignored the summons to travel to switzerland to serve her sentence she challenged the court ruling and secured a retrial which overturned the previous ruling however allen commented no one seriously suggested that the evidence had been fixed or that bhutto and zardari were not thieves on a grand scale bhutto was a client of mossack fonseca whose customer records were disclosed in the panama papers leak 7 september 2001 london law firm richard rooney and co told mfbvi mossack fonseca british virgin islands to create petroline international inc in the british virgin islands petroline international inc is owned by bhutto her nephew hassan ali jaffery bhutto and her aide and head of security rehman malik who later became a senator and interior minister in the government of yousaf raza gillani mossack fonseca had declined to do business with bhuttos first company similarly named petrofine fzc established in sharjah united arab emirates uae in 2000 the petrofine was politically sensitive they said and declined to accept mrs bhutto as a client a united nations committee chaired by former head of the us federal reserve paul volcker concluded in a 2005 investigation into abuses of the oilforfood program that petrofine fzc had paid us2\\xa0million to the iraqi government of saddam hussein to obtain us115–145\\xa0million in oil contracts in 2006 the pakistani national accountability bureau nab accused bhutto malik and ali jaffery of owning petrofine bhutto and the ppp denied this in april 2006 an nab court froze assets owned in pakistan and elsewhere by bhutto and zardari the 15\\xa0billion in assets were acquired through corrupt practices the nab said and noting that the 1997 swiss charges of criminal moneylaundering were still in litigation\\nat pakistans request interpol issued notices—but not arrest warrants—for bhutto and her husband on 27 january 2007 she was invited by the united states to speak to president george w bush and congressional and state department officials the us and uk had supported musharraf because of his role in assisting their war on terror—especially the war in afghanistan—but they gradually lost faith in his ability to rule successfully his domestic popularity was slipping a mid2007 poll gave him only a 26 approval rating in 2007 mass antimusharraf protests broke out in what was known as the lawyers movement pakistan was also experiencing growing levels of violence from islamist militants such as the siege of lal masjid official figures held that eight suicide bombings took place in 2006 and 44 in 2007 the us government increasingly saw bhutto as an important figure who could help to constrain pakistans domestic problems they nevertheless wanted a powersharing deal and did not want musharraf removed from power completely regarding him as a vital ally in their war on terror assisted by luis ayala the secretarygeneral of the socialist international in 2006 bhutto and sharif began a process of reconciliation  ayala believed that this was a prerequisite for ensuring pakistans transition back to democratic elections both bhutto and sharif had residences in london not far from one another facilitated by the lawyer aitzaz ahsan the pair developed a joint plan of action in may 2006 they both signed a charter of democracy a document calling for an end to military rule they established a committee consisting of four pakistani senators two from the ppp and two from the pakistan muslim league nawaz henceforth bhutto avoided openly criticizing sharif as she once had concerned about the instability of their ally the us government pushed musharraf to meet with bhutto and come to an arrangement that might strengthen his legitimacy this was also encouraged by the uk government in january 2007 musharraf held his first meeting with bhutto at a hotel in abu dhabi followed by further talks in june as a result of their discussions it was agreed that the pakistani authorities would drop all charges of corruption against both bhutto and her husband this was achieved through the introduction of the national reconciliation ordinance a measure which nullified all pending criminal proceedings against politicians the ordinance also lifted musharrafs ban on individuals serving more than two terms as prime minister\\nit was agreed that if musharraf stepped down from his military positions and was elected as a civilian president then bhutto would be willing to serve under him as prime minister many of musharrafs close allies had reservations about his concessions to bhutto the united states condoleezza rice and the uks jack straw worked together to ensure a transition back to electoral democracy in pakistan the uk and spain both dropped criminal investigations into bhuttos corruption although switzerland refused to do so in august 2007 the us ambassador to the united nations zalmay khalizad had several meetings with bhutto in new york city there bhutto also gave a public talk at the council of foreign relations bhutto and khalizad also traveled to a luncheon in aspen colorado to meet with prominent us political and business leaders in october 2007 musharraf was elected president by pakistans parliament in keeping with the agreement made by bhutto and musharraf the ppp representatives abstained rather than voting against musharrafs nomination the us publisher harpercollins paid bhutto half a million dollars to produce a book to be titled reconciliation cowritten with the us political scientist and journalist mark siegel it would be published in 2008 as reconciliation islam democracy and the west reconciliation was partly a response to the clash of civilisations theory that had been popularised by the american political scientist samuel p huntington during the 1990s she argued that huntingtons theory denied the universality of democratic ideals and created a selffulfilling prophecy of fear whereby it provoked the conflicts that it claimed to predict in reconciliation she proposed that western countries finance a new marshall plan to aid the poor in muslimmajority countries believing that this would improve islamic attitudes toward the west bhutto returned to pakistan in october 2007 arriving in karachi it was widely thought that she had a strong chance of becoming the countrys next prime minister in the 2008 national elections although her deal with musharraf and links with the us had dented her popularity and sharif—still in saudi arabia—was more popular in the opinion polls musharraf was annoyed at her arrival having requested that she return only after the election her husband and daughters remained in dubai while her son was still studying at oxford bhutto described the main problem facing her country as the clash between moderation and extremism and was pessimistic about her safety musharraf himself had survived several assassination attempts by islamist militants and warned bhutto that she too would be a target she requested that the us or uk take responsibility for her security but they refused and her security detail was instead organised by musharraf while her cavalcade was making its way through a crowd in karachi two bombs exploded killing 149 and injuring 402 bhutto herself was physically unharmed bhutto alleged that there were four suicide squads that had been dispatched to eliminate her and that there were key officials in the government involved in the plot she sent a list naming these officials to musharraf bhutto requested that musharraf bring in the british scotland yard or the united states federal bureau of investigation to investigate the crime but he refused relations between the pair were further strained when musharraf declared a state of emergency and suspended the constitution in november at which point bhutto was visiting dubai the ppp and pmln launched protests at musharrafs actions against the warnings of some of her advisors bhutto quickly returned to pakistan where she was briefly placed under house arrest she then publicly denounced musharraf fearing that any association with him would damage her credibility on 26 november sharif returned from exile that same day bhutto filed papers to contest two parliamentary seats in the larkana constituency as he had previously agreed with bhutto musharraf then retired as army chief and was sworn in as pakistans civilian president in early december bhutto met with sharif to publicise their demand that musharraf fulfil his promise to lift the state of emergency before januarys parliamentary elections threatening to boycott the vote if he failed to comply on 16 december musharraf did so\\nbhutto announced that the ppp would campaign on the five es employment education energy environment and equality the ppps manifesto called for greater civilian oversight of and restrictions on the military and intelligence agencies they also vowed to rid the intelligence services of elements driven by political or religious motives on the morning of 27 december 2007 bhutto met with afghan president hamid karzai in the afternoon she gave a speech at a ppp rally held in rawalpindis liaquat national bagh on leaving in a bulletproof vehicle she opened the cars escape hatch and stood up to wave to the surrounding crowds a man standing within two to three metres of the car fired three gunshots at her and detonated a suicide vest packed with ball bearings bhutto was fatally injured reports differ as to whether she was hit by bullets or by shrapnel from the explosion twentytwo others also died bhutto was rushed to rawalpindi general hospital but was clinically dead on arrival and attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful no autopsy was conducted and the body was swiftly transported to chaklala air base the following day she was buried next to her father in the bhutto family mausoleum garhi khuda bakhsh her family graveyard near larkana musharraf declared a threeday period of mourning while ppp supporters rioted in various parts of pakistan leading to at least 50 deaths authorities claimed that the assassin had been a teenage boy from south waziristan they claimed to have proof that the attack had been masterminded by baitullah mehsud leader of the pakistani taliban the united states central intelligence agency concurred that this was probable although mehsud denied the accusation mehsud nevertheless had a motive he believed that bhuttos proamerican and secularist agenda would undermine the pakistani talibans control of south waziristan and hinder the growth of sunni islamist radicalism alqaeda commander mustafa abu alyazid claimed responsibility for the assassination declaring that we terminated the most precious american asset which vowed to defeat the mujahideen the ppp accused the government of a coverup with several ppp figures claiming that bhutto had been killed by a sniper linked to the intelligence agencies within pakistan there was also public speculation that the attack might have been masterminded by india or the united states musharraf agreed to invite britains scotland yard to investigate the assassination although its eventual report proved inconclusive requests for the body to be exhumed for an autopsy were rejected by zardari in bhuttos political will she had designated her son bilawal who was then 19 as her political heir as chair of the ppp it also specified that her husband should serve as custodial chairman until bilawal completed his formal education zardari became cochair of the ppp the academic anna suvorova specified that bhuttos assassination created a real family cult one which was fuelled by various apocrypha rituals and relics in the wake of bhuttos death the election was postponed from january to february 2008 when it resulted in the formation of a coalition government bringing together the ppp and the pakistan muslim league nawaz the new coalition put forth ppp member yousuf raza gilani as prime minister musharraf facing likely impeachment resigned as president in august he fled to london although in february 2011 a rawalpindi court issued a subpoena for him on the grounds that he had not acted on known threats to bhutto and had provided insufficient security to protect her in september 2008 zardari was elected president of pakistan by the countrys electoral college he remained in that position until 2013 as president zardari called for a united nations investigation into his wifes assassination in 2009 the un secretary general ban kimoon established a threeperson team to lead the investigation comprising the chilean heraldo muñoz irish peter fitzgerald and indonesian marzuki darusman although it was not in the commissions remit to identify a culprit muñoz later expressed the view that the assassination was likely carried out by the pakistani taliban perhaps with the support of mehsud and that they may well have been assisted by rogue elements in the countrys intelligence agencies he also expressed the view that the original police investigation had been deliberately botched in february 2012 the pakistani official enquiry issued its final report placing responsibility for the attack with 27 different militant groups in may 2013 the states main prosecutor in the bhutto case zulfikar ali was himself assassinated in islamabad there was never a smoking gun in the bhutto investigation many in pakistan had reasons for wanting bhutto dead some saw her as corrupt and her killing was considered advantageous to both the military establishment and to the islamic fundamentalists who despised her bhutto was committed to democracy and modernisation and believed that the future of the islamic world lay in the embrace of these processes however allen thought that it was hard to pin down what bhuttos core political values actually were bhatia described bhutto as having liberal convictions and a selfevidently progressive outlook while suvorova thought that bhutto presented herself as the outpost of universal liberal values in conservative pakistan for a western audience bhutto biographer g s bhargava thought that in the context of pakistani politics she could pass for a social democrat her friend catherine drucker who knew her while the two women were at oxford university said bhuttos political views were then akin to those commonplace within the mild leftism of the day bhargava added that through her education in governance and politics at harvard and then oxford bhutto had a thorough exposure to political theory and practice in historical perspective as well as in the contemporary setting bhutto admired the thatcherite economic policies pursued by prime minister margaret thatcher in the united kingdom she was according to biographer mushtaq ahmed a zealous convert to privatisation and market economics bhutto advocated the creation of an expanded economically and politically stable middle class in pakistan believing that this was needed in order to sustain a stable democratic state allen commented that although the ppp had once been officially socialist in ideology bhutto was not a natural socialist or even as adept at talking the talk as zulfikar had been she disagreed with her fathers socialist economic policies and when in power sought to privatise various industries that had been nationalised in the 1970s ahmed thus suggested that while under bhutto the ppp continued to profess ideals of egalitarianism and claimed it would enhance the welfare of peasants and workers such progressive phraseology couched an absence of economic policies to benefit the poor instead ahmed thought its policies primarily benefited the privileged classes and was thus a rightwing rather than leftwing party during her years in office bhutto also did nothing to seriously challenge the feudal nature of rural pakistan under bhutto ahmed wrote people from the wealthy feudal class dominated the ppp both at the federal and provincial levels bhargava suggested that because of the period in which she was operating bhutto did not need to engage in the verbal radicalism employed by her father not needing to clamor for a socialist identity in order to win votes and allowing her to be a pragmatist in both word and deed lamb described bhutto at being skilled in using populist strategies in election campaigns in a 2007 article for the los angeles times bhuttos niece fatima bhutto called her a puppet democrat linked to the us governments neoconservative agenda under bhuttos leadership the ppp was officially secular as were the governments which she led however in pakistan at the time the term secularisation was often understood not as reflecting the separation of religious institutions and the state but rather had connotations of atheism and irreligion thus suvorova argued bhutto opposed the secularisation of islamic societies bhutto also took a hard stance against militant islamism although she had to compromise with pakistans powerful islamist lobby she favored a secular government for the country allen wrote that at no time in her years in power did bhutto westernized though she was feel comfortable in seriously challenging pakistans islamists although during her campaigns she vowed to abolish the hudud restrictions on women that zia had introduced she never did so instead these were revoked by musharraf in 2006 bhutto was indignant when faced with sexism and regarded herself as an ardent supporter of womens rights however suvorova stated that she was never a feminist in theory or practice bhutto expressed the view that there were differences between male and female leaders and that women leaders are more generous and forgiving male leaders tend to be more inflexible and more rigid in contrast to those islamic clerics who insisted that her involvement in politics contrasted with islamic values she insisted that there was no conflict in her view it was mens interpretation of our religion that restricted womens opportunities not our religion itself islam in fact had been quite progressive towards women from its inception bhutto described her main role model as fatimah the daughter of the islamic prophet muhammad stating that she admired her piety wisdom and courage she also described the indian prime minister indira gandhi as a political inspiration according to bhutto biographer shyam bhatia bhutto possessed a desire to be liked and to be popular and for this reason was prepared to be all things to all people having a chameleonlike quality to blend into her environment muñoz concurred describing bhutto as a woman of contradictions suvorova similarly observed that bhutto presented herself differently when in the west compared to when she was in pakistan while in pakistan bhutto presented herself as a conservative muslim who always wore her head covered but as a student in oxford she had adopted a more liberal lifestyle tending to wear a tshirt and jeans and occasionally drinking wine as a politician she was conscious of how her image was presented in pakistan she dressed modestly was never photographed with a glass lest it is interpreted as containing alcohol and would refuse to shake mens hands in the country she also wore a white dupatta on her head to placate islamist opposition her mother and other female family members had not covered their hair in this manner the journalist christina lamb believed that in being raised in a wealthy and aristocratic family bhutto was unable to appreciate the struggles of pakistans poorest the islamic studies scholar akbar s ahmed who went to school with bhutto wrote that she was a pampered and precocious child bhatia claimed that at oxford where he first met her bhutto was spoilt selfobsessed and prone to throwing temper tantrums although at the same time was humorous and generous willing to pay for her friends meals whenever at a restaurant allen suggested that bhutto retained her characteristic de haut en bas arrogance a relic of her feudal upbringing arguing that her key character flaw had been a belief in the special almost sacred destiny of herself and the bhutto family and that accordingly while she spoke like a democrat\\xa0 she thought and felt as a dynast in later life bhutto was accused of being addicted to power although allen thought it more accurate to state that she was addicted to adulation suggesting that this stemmed from a narcissistic element to bhuttos personality familial charisma is rare but in benazirs case the bhutto name matters in that her fathers charisma easily transferred to her she had her own charisma when she emerged in the 1980s as a young articulate welleducated and wellspoken woman her chief assets were her intelligence her confidence and the fact that she could talk to people of various backgrounds with empathy she had the rare quality of humor which she never lost in spite of leading an uncertain and challenging life above all she could use the media effectively her faults as a political leader were many too many stories of corruption stuck to her she was not a good administrator she was too inclined to listen to her small kitchen cabinet which very often consisted of people who would say what they thought she wanted to hear she became prime minister at a particularly young age and had no prior political or other cabinet experience — islamic studies scholar akbar s ahmed 2008 commentators and biographers have said that bhutto shared her fathers charisma but also his arrogance and that like him she was impatient with criticism the connection between bhutto and her father was endorsed by allen who stated that they had much in common strength charisma political instinct and the courage part and parcel of their arrogance that was so characteristic of both allen also believed that bhutto was so dedicated to her father that psychologically she was unable to admit to any imperfection in him after his death she repeatedly presented his execution as a martyrdom bhutto imitated many of her fathers mannerisms and his style of speech the journalist carla hall referred to her having a vaguely british accent she was an accomplished orator having honed her skill at public speaking while president of the oxford debating society having encountered her later in life muñoz regarded bhutto as a charming and intelligent woman close friends called her bb a name with which she signed some of her personal letters her parents gave her the childhood nickname of pinkie possibly alluding to her rosy complexion allen described bhutto as a woman of action rather than an intellectual bhuttos choice of reading material was usually either utilitarian or pleasurable rather than intellectual she enjoyed reading mills  boon romance novels and the celebrityfocused hello magazine she read a number of selfhelp books telling a friend that for all the lows in my life those selfhelp books helped me survive i can tell you her father had also encouraged her to read the writings of various prominent political figures among them napoleon bonaparte otto von bismarck vladimir lenin mustafa kemal atatürk and mao zedong she had a love of french and italian cuisine and was a great fan of the music of american singer neil diamond in a 2002 interview with the guardian bhutto described her allegiance to the sufi branch of sunni islam allen thought her to have some genuine if unorthodox religious belief mixed up with superstition bhargava stated that bhutto was dedicated and devout in her religious principles but modern and emancipated in her behavior and outlook  in conversation she often used the phrase inshallah and insisted that the quran supported the equality of the sexes bhutto was antiabortion and spoke forcefully against abortion most notably at the 1994 meeting of the international conference on population and development in cairo where she accused the west of seeking to impose adultery abortion intercourse education and other such matters on individuals societies and religions which have their own social ethos bhutto was the oldest of four children of these her younger sister sanam or sunny remained close to her throughout her life on returning to pakistan in 1987 bhuttos mother arranged for her marriage to the businessman asif ali zardari many of her friends were surprised that bhutto acquiesced to islamic tradition given her liberal attitudes however she later related that she felt obligations to my family and my religion to go through with it and that her high public profile made it difficult for her to find a husband through other means she consistently presented an image of respect and loyalty for her husband throughout the many accusations and periods of imprisonment he faced allen commented that it would probably never be known how happy the couples marriage was for bhutto always projected support and loyalty for her unpopular mate in the final years of bhuttos life she and her husband lived apart according to allen she would have been aware that a divorce or a public separation would have resulted in the end of her political career in pakistan due to social stigma around the subject in a 2007 interview bhutto said that she and her husband were living apart because of his medical requirements adding that she visited him every month in new york regarding the rumors of separation in 2008 bhuttos friend victoria schofield said that the marriage should not be judged by ordinary standards according to schofield after zardaris return from prison the bhuttos marriage was going through a process of readjustment in 2018 bhuttos friend ron suskind described the marriage as probably not all bad although added that bhutto did not consider her husband to be an equal partner in the marriage the couple had three children a son bilawal was born in september 1988 while she was campaigning for that years election she also had two daughters bakhtawar born on 25 january 1990 and aseefa born on 3 february 1993 when she gave birth to bakhtawar she became the first elected head of government to give birth while in office bhutto was devoted to her father and husband in later life she increasingly came to see success through the prism of her family the benazir bhutto of 1988 was a uniting figure for her country that of twenty years later a divisive one in retrospect her best and worst qualities seem so intimately linked that the course of her career might almost have been predicted — biographer brooke allen 2016 muñoz described bhutto as one of pakistans most important political figures a respected world leader and the leading stateswoman in the islamic world allen suggested that although bhuttos record in office was that of a corrupt compromised politician she displayed admirable qualities especially valor in the face of opposition within the islamic world bhutto was often regarded as a genuine muslim political leader and recognised as the head of pakistans most popular political party bhargava expressed the view that at the time of her initial election bhuttos personal popularity was tremendous larger than any that her father had previously achieved with suvorova suggesting that at this point in her life bhutto was often regarded as a quasisaint by her supporters in 1996 the guinness book of records named her the most popular international politician of the year and she also received such awards at the french legion of honour and oxford universitys doctor honours causa at the same time there were many pakistanis who despised her disliking her popularity her ties to western nations and her modernizing agenda extremist sunni islamist elements opposed her because of their belief that female leaders are unislamic and because she was a shia muslim they maintained that her participation in politics meant associating with men to whom she was not related and that this compromised the modesty required by islam conservative clerical opponents also claimed that by being prime minister bhutto was failing her religious duty which was to focus her energies on having as many children as possible ahmed stated that bhutto was one of the very few political leaders who had been able to assume the iconic status of a political martyr in the west while simultaneously evoking strong sentiments in the muslim world he therefore contrasted her with contemporaries like iraqs saddam hussein who were popular domestically but hated in the west and those like egypts hosni mubarak who curried favor with western governments while alienating their domestic audience bhutto gained popularity in western nations in part because she could present herself as being part of their world speaking a high standard of english and having been educated at harvard and oxford while her western supporters sometimes had doubts about her ability to govern they generally viewed her as a progressive figure who could advance democracy and counterterrorism in pakistan allen commented that the cards might have been stacked in bhuttos favor—she was rich educated aristocratic the favored daughter of a very powerful father—nevertheless her achievement was a remarkable one given the maledominated environment of late20th century pakistani society mushtaq ahmed similarly believed that for a woman to win an election in a maledominated society was an achievement and that her victory over the forces of reaction and persecution was an unprecedented accomplishment in political history ahmed thought that the election of a female prime minister in a muslimmajority country served as a proclamation that islam was a forwardthinking religion he added that as a pioneering female leader bhutto had barely half a dozen parallels among them indira gandhi thatcher golda meir chandrika kumaratunga and corazon aquino comparisons with aquino were often made — and welcomed by bhutto — because both women had fought against a military dictatorship and spent time in exile\\nshe became a global icon for womens rights and inspired many pakistani girls and women by her example the pakistani womens rights activist malala yousafzai—who received the 2014 nobel peace prize—cited bhutto as a personal inspiration writing in the american prospect magazine the journalist adele m stan called bhutto an imperfect feminist commenting that despite her efforts towards womens rights these were sometimes offset by her compromises with pakistans islamists and her support of the talibans rise to power in neighbouring afghanistan assessing her legacy william dalrymple wrote in the guardian that its wrong for the west simply to mourn benazir bhutto as a martyred democrat since her legacy was far murkier and more complex despite her western and positive image in the world bhuttos controversial policies and support have made her legacy much more complicated benazir bhutto failed to revert the controversial hudood ordinance – a contentious presidential ordinance which suppressed womens rights

the nuclear weapons and energy programme one of his top priorities he expanded the nuclear energy program and continued an atomic programme while following a policy of deliberate nuclear ambiguity

enrichment programme responding to us embargo nawaz announced that pakistan had no atomic bomb and would sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty if india did as well the embargo blocked plans for a frenchbuilt nuclear power plant so nawazs advisors intensively lobbied the international atomic energy agency iaea which allowed china to establish chasnuppi nuclear power plant and upgrade kanuppi

ruled 10–1 that the presidential order was unconstitutional that the president could dissolve the assembly only if a constitutional breakdown had occurred and that the governments incompetence or corruption was irrelevant justice sajjad ali shah was the only dissenting judge he later became 13th chief justice of pakistanrelevant issues of authority continued in july 1993 under pressure from the armed forces nawaz resigned under an agreement that also removed president khan from power chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee general shamim allam and the chief of army staff general abdul vahied kakar forced khan to resign from the presidency and ended the political standoff under the close scrutiny of the pakistan armed forces an interim and transitional government was formed and new parliamentary election was held after three months following 1993 elections the ppp returned to power under benazir bhutto nawaz offered his full cooperation as leader of the opposition but soon the ppp and pmln held parliament locked in dispute bhutto found it difficult to act effectively in the face of opposition from nawaz and also faced problems in her political stronghold of sindh province from her younger brother murtaza bhutto nawaz and murtaza bhutto formed the nawazbhutto axis and worked to undermine benazir bhuttos government tapping an anticorruption wave in pakistan they accused the government of corruption with major state corporations and slowing economic progress in 1994 and 1995 they made a train march from karachi to peshawar making critical speeches to huge crowds nawaz organised strikes throughout pakistan in september and october 1994 the death of murtaza bhutto in 1996 which allegedly involved benazirs spouse led to demonstrations in sindh and the government lost control of the province benazir bhutto became widely unpopular across the country and was ousted in october 1996 by 1996 continuous largescale corruption by the government of benazir bhutto had deteriorated the countrys economy which was nearing failure in the 1997 parliamentary elections nawaz and the pmln won an overwhelming victory with an exclusive mandate from across pakistan it was hoped that nawaz would deliver on promises to provide a stable conservative government and improve overall conditions nawaz was sworn as prime minister on 17 february nawaz had formed an alliance with altaf hussain of the mqm which fell apart following the assassination of hakim said nawaz then removed the mqm from parliament and assumed control of karachi while mqm was forced underground this led nawaz to claim an exclusive mandate and for the first time nawaz and the pmln had the control of sindh balochistan northwest frontier kashmir and punjab with a supermajority nawazs new government amended the constitution to restrict the powers of the president to dismiss governments  with the passing of the 14th amendment nawaz emerged as the most powerful elected prime minister in the country nawazs popularity peaked in may 1998 after conducting the countrys first nuclear weapons tests in response to tests by india when western countries suspended foreign aid nawaz froze the countrys foreign currency reserves and economic conditions worsened the country became embroiled in conflicts on two borders and nawazs longstanding relationships with the military establishment fell apart so that by mid1999 few approved of his policies during the 1997 elections nawaz promised to follow his policy of nuclear ambiguity while using nuclear energy to stimulate the economy however on 7 september before a state visit to the us nawaz acknowledged in a stn news interview that the country had had an atomic bomb since 1978 nawaz maintained that the issue of atomic capability is an established fact hence the debate on this atomic issue should come to an end  since 1972 pakistan had progressed significantly and we have left that developmental stage far behind pakistan will not be made a hostage to india by signing the ctbt before india on 1 december nawaz told the daily jang and the news international that pakistan would immediately become a party of the comprehensive nucleartestban treaty ctbt if india signed and ratified it first under his leadership the nuclear program had become a vital part of pakistans economic policy in may 1998 soon after indian nuclear tests nawaz vowed that his country would make a suitable reply on 14 may leader of the opposition benazir bhutto and mqm called for nuclear tests followed by calls from the public when india tested its nuclear weapons the second time it caused a great alarm in pakistan and pressure mounted on nawaz on 15 may nawaz put the armed forces on highalert and called a national security council meeting discussing the financial diplomatic military strategic and national security concerns only treasure minister sartaj aziz opposed the tests due to the economic recession low foreign exchange reserves and economic sanctions nawaz was initially hesitant of the economic impact of nuclear testing\\nand observed the international reaction to indias tests where an embargo had no economic effect failure to conduct the tests would put the credibility of pakistans nuclear deterrence in doubt which was emphasized when indian home minister lal kishanchand advani and defence minister george fernandes gloated and belittled pakistan angering nawaz on 18 may nawaz ordered the pakistan atomic energy commission paec to make preparation for the tests and put military forces on high alert to provide support on 21 may nawaz authorised nuclear weapon tests in balochistan on 27 may the day before testing the isi detected israeli f16 fighters conducting exercises and received intelligence that they had orders to attack pakistans nuclear facilities on behalf of india nawaz scrambled the pakistan air force and had nuclear bombs prepared for deployment according to political scientist shafik h hashmi the us and other nations assured nawaz that pakistan was safe the israeli attack never materialized on 28 and 30 may 1998 pakistan successfully carried out its nuclear tests codenamed chagaii and chagaiii following these test nawaz appeared on national television and stated if pakistan had wanted she would have conducted nuclear tests 15–20 years ago  but the abject poverty of the people of the region dissuaded  pakistan from doing so but the world instead of putting pressure on india  not to take the destructive road  imposed all kinds of sanctions on pakistan for no fault  if japan had its own nuclear capability  hiroshima and nagasaki would not have suffered atomic destruction at the hands of the united states nawazs political prestige reached its peak when the country went nuclear despite the intense international criticism and decline in foreign investment and trade nawazs domestic popularity increased as the tests made pakistan the first muslim country and seventh nation to become a nuclear power editorials were full of praise for the countrys leadership and advocated the development of nuclear deterrence leader of the opposition benazir bhutto congratulated nawaz for his bold decision in spite of the economic outcomes and felt that the tests erased doubts and fears which troubled the nation since the indopakistani war of 1971 in india opposition leaders in parliament blamed the government for starting a nuclear arms race nawaz was awarded an ig nobel prize for his aggressively peaceful explosions of atomic bombsrelevant nawaz built pakistans first major motorway the m2 motorway 3mm called the autobahn of south asia this publicprivate project was completed in november 1997 at a cost of us98912\\xa0million his critics questioned the layout of the highway its excessive length its distance from important cities and the absence of link roads with important towns it also appropriated funds designated for the peshawar–karachi indus highway benefiting punjab and kashmir at the cost of other provinces there was particular dissatisfaction in sindh and balochistan provinces and nawaz faced a lack of capital investment to finance additional projects nawaz loosened foreign exchange restrictions and opened karachi stock exchange to foreign capital but the government remained short of funds for investments due to economic pressures nawaz halted the national space programme this forced the space research commission to delay the launch of its satellite badriib which was completed in 1997 this caused frustration among the scientific community who criticised nawazs inability to promote science senior scientists and engineers attributed this to nawazs personal corruption that affected national security by the end of nawazs second term the economy was in turmoil the government faced serious structural issues and financial problems inflation and foreign debt stood at an alltime high and unemployment in pakistan had reached its highest point pakistan had debts of us32bn against reserves of little more than 1bn the international monetary fund imf had suspended aid demanding the

number of agreements to enlarge economic cooperation with italy and belgium and an agreement with the european union eu for the protection of intellectual industrial and commercial property rights however nawazs diplomatic efforts seemed to have gone to waste after conducting nuclear tests in may 1998 widespread international criticism brought pakistans reputation to a low since the indopakistani war of 1971 pakistan failed to gather any support from its allies at the un and trade agreements were repealed by the us europe and asian bloc pakistan was accused of allowing nuclear proliferation in june 1998 nawaz authorised a secret meeting between pakistan and israels ambassadors to the un and us and assured israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that pakistan would not transfer nuclear technology or materials to iran or other middle eastern countries israel responded with concerns that iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazis visit to pakistan shortly after the may 1998 nuclear weapons tests was a sign that pakistan was preparing to sell nuclear technology to iran in 1998 india and pakistan made an agreement recognising the principle of building an environment of peace and security and resolving all bilateral conflicts on 19 february 1999 indian premier atal bihari vajpayee paid a historic state visit to pakistan travelling on the inaugural delhi–lahore bus

ulhaq after his cabinet removed some of its controversial aspects the national assembly approved and passed the bill on 10 october 1998 by a vote of 151 to 16 with a majority in parliament nawaz reverted the semipresidential system in favour of a more parliamentary system with these amendments nawaz became the countrys strongest freely elected prime minister however these amendments failed to

deposing two judges close to alishah the deposed judges challenged nawazs orders on procedural grounds by filing a petition at quetta high court on 26 november 1997 alishah was restrained by his fellow judges from adjudicating in the case against the prime minister on 28 november nawaz appeared in the supreme court and justified his actions citing evidence against the two deposed judges alishah suspended the decision of quetta high court but soon the peshawar high court issued similar orders removing alishahs closest judges the associate chief justice of peshawar high court justice saeeduzzaman siddiqui declared himself acting chief justice alishah continued to assert his authority and persisted in hearing nawazs case on 30 november nawazs cabinet ministers and a large number of supporters entered the supreme court building disrupting the proceedings the chief justice requested the military police and subsequently struck down the thirteenth amendment restoring the power of the president however the militarybacked nawaz refused to obey the presidents orders to remove him nawaz forced president farooq leghari to resign and appointed wasim sajjad as acting president then ousted alishah to end the constitutional crisis on 29 november 2006 nawaz and the pmln issued a formal apology for their actions to alishah and leghari a written apology was presented to alishah at his residence and later his party issued a white paper in parliament formally apologising for their wrongdoing nawaz passed the controversial antiterrorist act on 17 august 1997 which established antiterrorism courts the supreme court later rendered the act unconstitutional however nawaz made amendments and received the permission of the supreme court to establish these courts from 1981 until 1999 nawaz enjoyed extremely cordial relations with the pakistan armed forces and was the only senior civilian leader to have friendly relations with the military establishment during that period however when chief of army staff general jehangir karamat advocated for a national security council nawaz interpreted this as a conspiracy to return the military to an active political roleclarification needed in october 1998 three months before the end of his term karamat was forced to resign this was controversial even within nawazs cabinet and was seen as the leastpopular moment of nawazs administration military lawyers and civilian law experts saw this as unconstitutional and a violation of military justice code however media minister syed mushahid hussain felt that pakistan was finally becoming a normal democratic society not beholden to its military nawaz promoted general pervez musharraf to replace karamat also making musharraf chairman of the joint chiefs despite his lack of seniority admiral fasih bokhari resigned as chief of naval staff in protest bokhari lodged a protest against the kargil debacle and called for the courtmartial of musharraf who nawaz said acted alonefurther explanation needed in august india shot down a pakistan navy reconnaissance aircraft in the atlantique incident killing 16 naval officerscitation needed the greatest number of combat casualties for the navy since the indopakistani naval war of 1971 nawaz failed to gain foreign support against india for the incident which newly appointed chief of naval staff admiral abdul aziz mirza viewed as a lack of support for the navy in wartime nawaz further lost the confidence of the marines for failing to defend the navy at the international court of justice icj in september relations with the air force likewise deteriorated when chief of air staff general parvaiz mehdi qureshi accused the prime minister of not consulting the air force in matters critical to national security two months later after steadily worsening relations with the armed forces nawaz was deposed by musharraf and martial law was established throughout the country the simultaneous conflicts in the kargil war with india and afghanistans civil war along with economical turmoil turned public opinion against nawaz and his policies on 12 october 1999 nawaz attempted to remove musharraf for military failures and replace him with general ziauddin butt nawazs mindset was to remove the chairman joint chiefs and the chief of army staff first then depose the other armed forces chiefs who had destroyed his credibility musharraf who was in sri lanka attempted to return on a pia commercial flight nawaz ordered the sindh police force to arrest musharraf fearing a coup détat he further ordered the jinnah terminal to be sealed to prevent the landing of the airliner the a300 aircraft was ordered to land at nawabshah airport now shaheed benazirabad airport there musharraf contacted top pakistan army generals who took over the country and ousted nawazs administration nawaz was taken to adiala jail for trial by a military judge musharraf later assumed control of the government as chief executive a single protest was held by sardar mohsin abbasi in front of the supreme court on 17 october on the first hearing of nawaz raja zafarulhaq sir anjam khan zafer ali shah and sardar mohsin abbasi were the only supporters left after the first six months many of nawazs cabinet ministers and his constituents were divided during the court proceedings and remained neutral dissidents such as chaudhry shujaat hussain remained quiet and later formed pakistan muslim league q pmlq splitting nawazs party into small factions the military police initiated massive arrests of the pml

pay a fine of us400000 on grounds of tax evasion and he was sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment pakistan and saudi arabia under nawaz and king fahd had enjoyed extremely close business and cultural relations that is sometimes attributed as a special relationship saudi arabia was shocked at the news of the coup amid pressure by fahd and us president bill clinton the military court avoided a death sentence for sharif fahd had expressed concern that the death sentence would provoke intense ethnic violence in pakistan as had happened in the 1980s following the execution of zulfikar ali bhutto under an agreement facilitated by saudi arabia nawaz was placed in exile for the next 10\\xa0years and agreed not to take part in politics in pakistan for 21\\xa0years he also forfeited property worth

ordinance drafted in october 2007 however the ordinance faced mounting public pressure and an uncompromising judiciary in addition it only dealt with charges up to 1999 this left open the possibility

have had to deal with charges relating to evading duties on an armoured bmw commissions from a polish tractor manufacturer and a kickback from a gold bullion dealer in switzerland bhutto and zardari

his family offered to accept musharrafs demand to exhume bhuttos body in exchange for a united nations inquiry but musharraf rejected the proposal in bhuttos political will she had designated zardari her successor as party leader however their nineteenyearold son bilawal bhutto zardari became chairman of the ppp because zardari favoured bilawal to represent bhuttos legacy in part to avoid division within the party due to his own unpopularity he did however serve as cochairman of the ppp for at least three years until bilawal completed his studies overseas zardari called for no delays to the 8 january parliamentary elections and for the participation of all opposition parties other major political parties quickly agreed to participate ending any chance of a boycott because of the turmoil

pakistan muslim leagueq pmlq he and nawaz sharif leader of the pakistan muslim league n party pmln threatened national protests if any voterigging was attempted he himself could not run for parliament

murree declaration to the reinstatement by 30 april 2008 of 60 judges previously sacked by musharraf the deadline was later extended to 12 may he and sharif held unsuccessful talks at london in may

constitutional amendment that would remove the power of the president to dismiss parliament by late may the coalition was set in a confrontation with musharraf at the same time the government was successful in getting pakistan readmitted to the commonwealth he and sharif met in lahore in june 2008 to discuss musharrafs removal and the constitutional amendments which the pmln viewed as not going far enough to fulfill the murree declaration he opposed impeachment calls because he claimed the coalition did not have the twothirds majority in both legislative bodies—national assembly and senate he was unwilling to restore the judiciary as divisions in the coalition grew and popular sentiment shifted towards sharif the coalition criticised the government for barring sharif from competing in the june byelections because of the impasses over musharraf and the judiciary the coalition could not address rising food shortages and spiraling inflation which was the highest in 30 years in august 2008 zardari relented and the coalition agreed to proceed full speed towards musharrafs impeachment by drafting a chargesheet against him the coalition charged him with high treason

musharraf favoured the chief of naval staff admiral bokhari to take on this role and claimed that he did not care prime minister sharif was displeased by this suggestion due to the hostile nature of his relationship with the admiral musharraf further exacerbated his divide with nawaz sharif after recommending the forced retirement of senior officers close to the prime minister including lieutenantgeneral tariq pervez also known by his names initials as tp commander of xii corps who was a brotherinlaw of a high profile cabinet minister according to musharraf lieutenantgeneral tp was an illmannered foulmouthed illdisciplined officer who caused a great deal of dissent within the armed forces nawaz sharifs announcement of the promotion of general musharraf to chairman joint chiefs

soldiers problems with his lifelong friend chief of air staff air chief marshal pervez mehdi also arose when air chief refrained to participate or authorise any air strike to support the elements of army operations in the kargil region during the last meeting with the prime minister musharraf faced grave criticism on results produced by kargil infiltration by the principal military intelligence mi director lieutenantgeneral jamshed gulzar kiani who maintained in the meeting  whatever has been written there is against logic if you catch your enemy by the jugular vein he would react with full force if you cut enemy supply lines the only option for him will be to ensure supplies by air sic at that situation the indian army was unlikely to confront and it had to come up to the occasion it is against wisdom that you dictate to the enemy to keep the war limited to a certain front nawaz sharif has maintained that the operation was conducted without his knowledge however details of the briefing he got from the military before and after the kargil operation have become public before the operation between january and march sharif was briefed about the operation in three separate

immediately there were no organised protests within the country to the coup that was widely criticised by the international community consequently pakistan was suspended from the commonwealth of nations sharif was put under house arrest and later exiled to saudi arabia on his personal request and under a contract the senior military appointments in the interservices were extremely important and crucial for musharraf to keep the legitimacy and the support for his coup in the joint interservices starting with the paf musharraf pressured president tarar to appoint mostjunior air marshal to fourstar rank particularly someone with musharraf had experienced working during the interservices operations once airchief marshal pervez kureshi was retired the most junior air marshal muschaf mir

finance minister and abdul sattar as foreign minister in early november he released details of his assets to the public in late december 1999 musharraf dealt with his first international crisis when india accused pakistans involvement in the indian airlines flight 814 hijacking though united states president bill clinton pressured musharraf to ban the alleged group behind the hijacking — harkatulmujahideen pakistani officials refused because of fears of reprisal from political parties such as jamaateislami in march 2000 musharraf banned political rallies in a television interview given in 2001 musharraf openly spoke about the negative role of a few highranking officers in the pakistan armed forces in states affairs musharraf labelled many of his senior professors at ndu as

treason for preventing musharrafs flight from landing at karachi airport on the day of the coup his trial began in early march 2000 in an antiterrorism court which is designed for speedy trials he testified musharraf began preparations of a coup after the kargil conflict sharif was placed in adiala jail infamous for hosting zulfikar ali bhuttos trial and his leading defence lawyer iqbal raad was shot dead in karachi in midmarch sharifs defence team blamed the military for intentionally providing their lawyers with inadequate protection the court proceedings were widely accused of being a show trial sources from pakistan claimed that musharraf and his military governments officers were in full mood to exercise tough conditions on sharif and intended to send nawaz sharif to the gallows to face a similar fate to that of zulfikar ali bhutto in 1979 it was the pressure on musharraf exerted by saudi arabia and the united states to exile sharif after it was confirmed that the court is about to give its verdict on nawaz sharif over treason charges and the court would sentence sharif to death sharif signed an agreement with musharraf and his military government and his family was

the legal framework order no 2002 which added numerous amendments to the constitution musharraf called for nationwide political elections in the country after accepting the ruling of the supreme court of pakistan musharraf was the first military president to accept the rulings of the supreme court and holding free and fair elections in 2002 part of his vision to return democratic rule to the country in october 2002 pakistan held general elections which the promusharraf pmlq won wide margins although it had failed to gain an absolute majority the pmlq formed a government with farright religious parties coalition the mma and the liberals mqm the coalition legitimised musharrafs rule after the elections the pmlq nominated zafarullah khan jamali for the office of prime minister which musharraf also approved after first session at the parliament musharraf voluntarily transferred the powers of chief executive to prime minister zafarullah khan jamali musharraf succeeded to pass the xvii amendment which grants powers to dissolve the parliament with approval required from the supreme court within two years jamali proved to be an ineffective prime minister as he forcefully implemented his policies in the country and caused problems with the business class elites musharraf accepted the resignation of jamali and asked his close colleague chaudhry shujaat hussain to appoint a new prime minister in place hussain nominated finance minister shaukat aziz who had been impressive due to his performance as finance minister in 1999 musharraf regarded aziz as his right hand and preferable choice for the office of prime minister with aziz appointed as prime minister musharraf transferred all executive powers to aziz as he trusted shaukat aziz aziz proved to be extremely capable in running the government under his leadership economic growth reached to a maximum level which further stabilised musharrafs presidency aziz swiftly quietly and quickly undermined the elements seeking to undermine musharraf which became a factor in musharrafs trust in him between 2004 and 2007 aziz approved many projects that did not require musharrafs permission in 2010 all constitutional changes carried out by musharraf and azizs policies were reverted by the 18th amendment which restored the powers of the prime minister and reduced the role of the president to levels below that of even the premusharraf era he suspended the countrys democratic process and imposed two states of emergency leading to his conviction for treason during his rule he implemented both liberal reforms and authoritarian measures while also forming alliances and impacting the situation in balochistan the legacy of musharrafs era serves as a cautionary tale for future leaders in pakistan the president musharraf stood clapping his hands right next to us as we sang azadi and jazba and moved to the beat with us it was such a relief to have a coolest leader in the office the presidency of pervez musharraf helped bring the liberal forces to the national level and into prominence for the first time in the history of pakistan he granted national amnesty to the political workers of the liberal parties like muttahida qaumi movement and pakistan muslim league q and supported mqm in becoming a central player in the government musharraf disbanded the cultural policies of the previous prime minister nawaz sharif and quickly adopted benazir bhuttos cultural policies after disbanding indian channels in the country his cultural policies liberalised pakistans media and he issued many television licences to the privatesector to open television centres and media houses the television dramas film industry theatre music and literature activities were personally encouraged by pervez musharraf under his policies the rock music bands gained a following in the country and many concerts were held each week his cultural policies the film theatre rock and folk music and television programs were extremely devoted to and promoted the national spirit of the country in 2001 musharraf got on stage with the rock music band junoon and sang the national song with the band on political fronts musharraf faced fierce opposition from the ultraconservative alliance the mma led by clergyman maulana noorani in pakistan maulana noorani was remembered as a mystic religious leader and had preached spiritual aspects of islam all over the world as part of the world islamic mission although the political deadlock posed by maulana noorani was neutralised after nooranis death musharraf yet had to face the opposition from ard led by benazir bhutto of the ppp on 18 september 2005 musharraf made a speech before a broad based audience of jewish leadership sponsored by the american jewish congresss council for world jewry in new york city he was widely criticised by middle eastern leaders but was met with some praise among jewish leadership musharraf allied with the united states against the taliban in afghanistan after the september 11 attacks as the closest state to the taliban government musharraf was in negotiations with them in the aftermath of the attacks regarding the severity of the situation before allying with the us and declaring to stamp out extremism he was however criticised by nato and the afghan government of not doing enough to prevent pro taliban or alqaeda militants in the pakistanafghanistan border region tensions with afghanistan increased in 2006 with hamid karzai then president of afghanistan accusing musharraf of failing to act against afghan taliban leaders in pakistan claiming that the taliban leader mullah omar was based in quetta pakistan in response musharraf hit back saying none of this is true and karzai knows it george w bush encouraged the two leaders to unite in the war on terror during a trio meeting violence in the khyber pakhtunkhwa escalated in the late 2000s amid fighting between militants and pakistani soldiers backed by the us after the 2001 gujarat earthquake musharraf expressed his sympathies to indian prime minister atal bihari vajpayee and sent a plane load of relief supplies to india in 2004 musharraf began a series of talks with india to resolve the kashmir dispute in 2004 a ceasefire was agreed upon along the line of control many troops still patrol the border in 2006 king abdullah of saudi arabia visited pakistan for the first time as king musharraf honoured king abdullah with the nishanepakistan musharraf received the king abdulaziz medallion in 2007 from september 2001 until his resignation in 2007 from the military musharrafs presidency was affected by scandals relating to nuclear weapons which were detrimental to his authoritative legitimacy in the country and in the international community in october 2001 musharraf authorised a sting operation led by fia to arrest two physicists sultan bashiruddin mahmood and chaudhry abdul majeed because of their supposed connection with the taliban after they secretly visited talibancontrolled afghanistan in 2000 the local pakistani media widely circulated the reports that mahmood had a meeting with osama bin laden where bin laden had shown interest in building a radiological weapon it was later discovered that neither scientist had any indepth knowledge of the technology in december 2001 musharraf authorised security hearings and the two scientists were taken into the custody by the jag branch jag security hearings continued until early 2002 another scandal arose as a consequence of disclosure by pakistani nuclear physicist abdul qadeer khan on 27 february 2001 musharraf spoke highly of khan at a state dinner in islamabad and he personally approved khans appointment as science advisor to the government in 2004 musharraf relieved abdul qadeer khan from his post and initially denied knowledge of the governments involvement in nuclear proliferation despite khans claim that musharraf was the big boss of the proliferation ring following this musharraf authorised a national security hearing which continued until his resignation from the army in 2007 according to zahid malik musharraf and the military establishment at that time acted against abdul qadeer khan in an attempt to prove the loyalty of pakistan to the united states and western world the investigations backfired on musharraf and public opinion turned against him the populist ard movement which included the major political parties such as the pml and the ppp used the issue to bring down musharrafs presidency the debriefing of abdul qadeer khan severely damaged musharrafs own public image and his political prestige in the country he faced bitter domestic criticism for attempting to vilify khan specifically from opposition leader benazir bhutto in an interview to daily times bhutto maintained that khan had been a scapegoat in the nuclear proliferation scandal and said that she didnt believe that such a big scandal could have taken place under the nose of general musharraf musharrafs longstanding ally the mqm published criticism of musharraf over his handling of abdul qadeer khan the ard movement and the political parties further tapped into the public anger and mass demonstrations against musharraf the credibility of the united states was also badly damaged the us itself refrained from pressuring musharraf to take further action against khan while abdul qadeer khan remained popular in the country musharraf could not withstand the political pressure and his presidency was further weakened musharraf quickly pardoned abdul qadeer khan in exchange for cooperation and issued confinement orders against khan that limited khans movement he handed over the case of abdul qadeer khan to prime minister aziz who had been supportive towards khan personally thanking him the services of dr qadeer khan are unforgettable for the country on 4 july 2008 in an interview abdul qadeer khan laid the blame on president musharraf and later on benazir bhutto for transferring the technology claiming that musharraf was aware of all the deals and he was the big boss for those deals khan said that musharraf gave centrifuges to north korea in a 2000 shipment supervised by the armed forces the equipment was sent in a north korean plane loaded under the supervision of pakistan security officials nuclear weapons expert david albright of the institute for science and international security agreed that khans activities were governmentsanctioned after musharrafs resignation abdul qadeer khan was released from house arrest by the executive order of the supreme court of pakistan after musharraf left the country the new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee general tärik majid terminated all further debriefings of abdul qadeer khan few believed that abdul qadeer khan acted alone and the affair risked gravely damaging the armed forces which oversaw and controlled the nuclear weapons development and of which musharraf was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff until his resignation from military service on 28 november 2007 when musharraf came to power in 1999 he promised that the corruption in the government bureaucracy would be cleaned up however some claimed that the level of corruption did not diminish throughout musharrafs time musharraf instituted prohibitions on foreign students access to studying islam within pakistan an effort that began as an outright ban but was later reduced to restrictions on obtaining visas in december 2003 musharraf made a deal with mma a sixmember coalition of hardline islamist parties agreeing to leave the army by 31 december 2004 with that partys support promusharraf legislators were able to muster the twothirds supermajority required to pass the seventeenth amendment which retroactively legalised musharrafs 1999 coup and many of his decrees musharraf reneged on his agreement with the mma and promusharraf legislators in the parliament passed a bill allowing musharraf to keep both offices on 1 january 2004 musharraf had won a confidence vote in the electoral college of pakistan consisting of both houses of parliament and the four provincial assemblies musharraf received 658 out of 1170 votes a 56 majority but many opposition and islamic members of parliament walked out to protest the vote as a result of this vote his term was extended to 2007 prime minister zafarullah khan jamali resigned on 26 june 2004 after losing the support of musharrafs party pmlq his resignation was at least partially due to his public differences with the party chairman chaudhry shujaat hussain this was rumoured to have happened at musharrafs command jamali had been appointed with the support of musharrafs and the promusharraf pmlq most pmlq parliamentarians formerly belonged to the pakistan muslim league party led by sharif and most ministers of the cabinet were formerly senior members of other parties joining the pmlq after the elections upon being offered positions musharraf nominated shaukat aziz the minister for finance and a former employee of citibank and head of citibank private banking as the new prime minister in

field the national assembly voted in favour of the womens protection bill on 15 november 2006 and the senate approved it on 23 november 2006 president general pervez musharraf signed into law the womens protection bill on 1 december 2006 the bill places rape laws under the penal code and allegedly does away with harsh conditions that previously required victims to produce four male witnesses and exposed the victims to prosecution for adultery if they were unable to prove the crime\\nhowever the womens protection bill has been criticised heavily by many for paying continued lip service and failing to address the actual problem by its roots repealing the hudood ordinance in this context musharraf has also been criticised by women and human rights activists for not following up his words by action the human rights commission of pakistan hrcp said that the socalled womens protection bill is a farcical attempt at making hudood ordinances palatable outlining the issues of the bill and the continued impact on women his government increased reserved seats for women in assemblies to increase womens representation and make their presence more effective the number of reserved seats in the national assembly was increased from 20 to 60 in provincial assemblies 128 seats were reserved for women this situation has brought out increase participation of women in the 1988 and 2008

pronouncing captain hammad a fellow military man and the accused in the case innocent before the judicial inquiry was complete shazia alleged that she was forced by the government to leave the country in an interview given to the washington post in september 2005 musharraf said that pakistani women who had been the victims of rape treated rape as a moneymaking concern and were only interested in the publicity to make money and get a canadian visa he subsequently denied making these comments but the post made available an audio recording of the interview in which musharraf could be heard making the quoted remarks musharraf also denied mukhtaran mai a pakistani rape victim the right to travel abroad until pressured by us state department the remarks made by musharraf sparked outrage

badakhshan province of afghanistan this corridor stretches eastward connecting afghanistan to xinjiang china it also separates the gornobadakhshan autonomous region of tajikistan in the north from the northern regions of pakistan in the south this high mountain valley serves as the source of both the panj and pamir rivers which converge to form the larger amu river for countless centuries a vital trade route has traversed this valley facilitating the movement of travelers to and from east south and central asia the corridor was formed after an 1893 agreement between mortimer durand of the british raj and emir abdur rahman khan of afghanistan creating the durand line this narrow strip acted as a buffer zone between the russian empire and the british empire the regions of russian turkestan now in tajikistan and the part of british india now in pakistan and the contested region of gilgitbaltistan its eastern end bordered chinas xinjiang region then claimed by the qing dynasty the corridor is in the wakhan district of afghanistans badakhshan province as of 2020 it had 17167 residents the northern part of the wakhan populated by the wakhi and pamiri people is also referred

zorkul in the west and the high peaks of the pamir mountains in the east to the north is tajikistans gornobadakhshan autonomous region to the south the corridor is bounded by the high mountains of the hindu kush and karakoram along the southern flank of the corridor there are two mountain passes that connect the corridor to its neighbours the broghol pass offers access to the khyber pakhtunkhwa region of pakistan while the irshad pass connects the corridor to gilgitbaltistan the dilisang pass which also connects to gilgitbaltistan is disused the easternmost pass as indicated above is the

trading route between badakhshan and yarkand it appears that marco polo came this way the portuguese jesuit priest bento de goes crossed from the wakhan to china between 1602 and 1606 in may 1906 sir aurel stein explored the wakhan and reported that at that time 100 pony loads of goods crossed annually to china there were further crossings in 1874 by captain te gordon of the british army in 1891 by francis younghusband and in 1894 by lord curzon early travellers used one of three routes from a nonafghan point of view the corridor is in part a political creation from the great game between british india and russian empire in the north an agreement between the empires in 1873 effectively split the historic region of wakhan by making the panj and pamir rivers the border between afghanistan and the thenrussian empire in the south the durand line agreement of 1893 marked the boundary between british india and afghanistan this left a narrow strip of land ruled by afghanistan as a buffer between the two empires which became known as the wakhan corridor in the 20th century the corridor has been closed to regular traffic for over a century and there is no modern road there is a rough road from ishkashim to sarhade broghil built in the 1960s but only rough paths beyond these paths run some 100\\xa0km 60\\xa0mi from the road end to the chinese border at wakhjir pass and further to the far end of the little pamir jacob townsend has speculated on the possibility of drug smuggling from afghanistan to china via the wakhan corridor and wakhjir pass but concluded that due to the difficulties of travel and border crossings it would be minor compared to that conducted via tajikistans gornobadakhshan autonomous province or through pakistan both having much more accessible routes into china the remoteness of the region has meant that despite the longrunning wars of afghanistan since the late 1970s the region has remained virtually untouched by conflict and many locals mostly composed of ethnic pamir and kyrgyz are not aware of the wars in the country the islamic republic of afghanistan asked the peoples republic of china on several occasions to open the border in the wakhan corridor for economic reasons or as an alternative supply route for fighting the taliban insurgency the chinese resisted largely due to unrest in its far western province of xinjiang which borders the corridor in december 2009update it was reported that the united states had asked china to open the corridor in july 2021 the area came under the taliban control for the first time during the groups summer offensive it was reported that hundreds of ethnic kyrgyz nomads along with their livestock attempted to flee north into tajikistan it is patrolled by forces of the islamic emirate of

the adjutant general of the army on november of the same yearcitation needed general sir douglas gracey relinquished the command of the pakistan army on 23 january 1951 under pressure of calls for nationalisation of the army the pakistan government had already called for appointing native commandersinchief of the army air force and navy and dismissed deputation appointments from the british military the general headquarters sent the nomination papers to the prime ministers secretariat for the appointment of commanderinchiefcitation needed there were four senior officers in the race majorgeneral akbar khan majorgeneral iftikhar khan majorgeneral ishfakul majid and majorgeneral nam raza among these officers akbar was the senior having been commissioned in 1920 initially general iftikhar khan commissioned in 1929 was selected for appointment as the first native commanderinchief of the army but he died in an airplane crash en route to take command after finishing the senior staff officers course in the united kingdom all three remaining generals were bypassed including the recommended seniormost majorgeneral akbar khan and majorgeneral ishfakul majid commissioned in 1924citation needed defence secretary iskandar mirza at that time played a crucial role in lobbying for the army post selection by presenting convincing arguments to prime minister ali khan to promote the most junior majorgeneral ayub khan commissioned in 1928 to the post despite the fact that his name was not included in the nomination listcitation needed ayubs papers of promotion were approved and he was appointed the first native commanderinchief of the pakistan army on 17 january 1951 by prime minister ali khan this ended the transitional role of british military officers although the pakistani government announced the appointment of the navys native commander in chief in 1951 it was ayub khan who helped viceadmiral ms choudhri to be appointed as the first native navy commander in chief also in 1953 the events surrounding ayubs appointment set the precedent for a native general being promoted out of turn ostensibly because he was the least ambitious of the generals in the line of promotion and the most loyal to civil government at that time ayub alongside admiral choudhri cancelled and disbanded the british military tradition in the navy and the army when the us militarys advisers were dispatched to the pakistani military in 1955–57 british military traditions were only kept in the air force due to a british commander and major staff consisting of royal air force officers in 1953 ayub visited turkey his first foreign visit as an army commander in chief and was said to have been impressed with turkish military tradition he met only with the turkish defence minister during his visit thereafter he went to the united states and visited the us state department and pentagon to lobby for forging military relations he termed this visit as a medical visit but made a strong plea for military aid which was not considered due to indias opposition on 24 february 1954 ayub signed the central treaty organization cento pact for pakistan and his role in national politics along with that of defense minister mirza began to grow in 1954 prime minister muhammad ali bogras relations with the military and governorgeneral ghulam muhammad deteriorated on issues of the economy pressure built up to reconstruct the cabinet which eventually witnessed general ayub khan becoming the defence minister and iskander mirza as home minister in october 1954 ayub khan disdained civilian politicians whose factional infighting had for years prevented adoption of a constitution he wrote that he reluctantly joined the cabinet as defence minister with two clear objectives to save the armed forces from the interference of the politicians and to unify the provinces of west pakistan into one unit the controversial one unit scheme integrated the four western provinces into one political entity west pakistan as a counterbalance against the numerically superior population of east bengal which was renamed east pakistan the province of punjab supported the project but all the other provinces protested against it and its centralisation of power opposition was particularly strong in east bengal where it was seen as an attack on the democratic principle of political egalitarianism in 1955 prime minister bogra was dismissed by governorgeneral malik ghulam muhammad and he was succeeded by the new prime minister chaudhry muhammad ali as the defence minister after the 1954 provincial elections in east pakistan the awami league formed the government there while west pakistan was governed by the pml but the pml government collapsed in 1956 he was called on to join the cabinet as defence minister by prime minister hs suhrawardy and maintained closer relations with iskander mirza who now had become the first president of the country after the successful promulgation of the constitution in 1956citation needed in 1957 president mirza promoted him from acting full general to the substantive rank of full general around this time the mod led by general ayub khan began to see the serious interservice rivalry between the general headquarters staff and the naval headquarters staff commander in chief of navy viceadmiral m s choudri and his nhq staff had been fighting with the finance ministry and the mod over the issues of rearmament and contingency plans in 1958 he chaired the joint military meeting where he became involved in a heated discussion with admiral m s choudri he reportedly complained against admiral choudri to president mirza and criticized admiral choudri for neither having the brain imagination or depth of thought to understand such defence problems nor the vision or the ability to make any contribution the impasse was broken with admiral choudhri resigning from the navy in protest as a result of having differences with the navys plans of expansion and modernization under threat of being dismissed prime minister hs suhrawardy resigned and prime minister ii chundiragar took over the post but in a mere two months he too tendered his resignation after losing a vote of no confidence in the national assembly the constituent assembly then elected sir feroz noon for the post of the prime minister noon had much wider support from the western republican party the eastern awami league and the krishak sramikselfpublished source this new alliance threatened president iskander mirza because suhrawardy and feroz began campaigning to become prime minister and president in the upcoming general electionsselfpublished source also the conservative pakistan muslim league led by its president aq khan was threatening to engage in civil disobedience these events were against president mirza hence he was willing to dissolve even pakistans one unit for his advantage on 7 october 1958 president mirza abrogated the constitution after sending a letter to prime minister feroz announcing the coup détat most of the countrys politicians only became aware of the coup the next morning only us ambassador to pakistan james langley was kept fully informed of political developments in the country president mirza appointed general ayub chief martial law administrator cmla who then declared martial law ayub justified his part by declaring that history would never have forgiven us if the present chaotic conditions were allowed to go on any further and his goal was to restore a democracy that the people can understand and work not to rule indefinitely when the public was informed public reactions were mixed the immediate crackdown on smuggling corruption and trafficking won ayub plenty of support from the commoners the middleclass and the uppermiddle class were more apprehensivecitation needed president mirza himself was apprehensive though for a different reason he had been contemplating replacing ayub khan and it seems that ayub knew immediately after the supreme courts chief justice munir justified the coup under the doctrine of necessity ayub sent the military into the presidential palace and exiled mirza to england this was largely done with the support of admiral a r khan general azam khan nawab of kalabagh amir khan general dr wajid khan and air marshal asghar khancitation needed the regime came to power with the intent of instituting widespread reform like mirza ayub advocated for greater centralization of power and his ruling style was more american than british he vowed to give people access to speedier justice curb the crippling birth rate and take appropriate steps including land reforms and technological innovation to develop agriculture so that the country could feed itself ayub finally restored civil administration although he maintained the presidency and relied on an intricate web of spy agencies to maintain supremacy over the bureaucracy including calling upon civilian intelligence agenciescitation needed in 1960 a referendum that functioned as the electoral college was held that asked the general public do you have confidence in muhammad ayub khan the voter turnout was recorded at 956 and such confirmation was used as impetus to formalise the new system – a presidential system ayub khan was elected president for the next five years and decided to pay his first state visit to the united states with his wife and also daughter begum naseem aurangzeb in july 1961 highlights of his visit included a state dinner at mount vernon a visit to the islamic center of washington and a ticker tape parade in new york city a constitutional commission was setup under the supreme court to implement the work on the constitution that was led by chief justice muhammad shahabuddin and supreme court justices the commission reported in 1961 with its recommendations but president ayub remained unsatisfied he eventually altered the constitution so that it was entirely different from the one recommended by the shahabuddin commission the constitution reflected his personal views of politicians and the restriction of using religions in politics his presidency restored the writ of government through the promulgated constitution and restored political freedom by lifting the martial law enforced since 1958 the new constitution respected islam but did not declare islam as the state religion and was viewed as a liberal constitution it also provided for election of the president by 80000 later raised to 120000 basic democrats who could theoretically make their own choice but who were essentially under his control he justified this as analogous to the american electoral college and cited thomas jefferson as his inspiration the ayub administration guided the print newspapers through his takeover of key opposition papers and while ayub khan permitted a national assembly it had only limited powers on 2 march 1961 he passed and signed the muslim family laws bill through the ordinance under which unmitigated polygamy was abolished consent of the current wife was made mandatory for a second marriage and brakes were placed on the practice of instant divorce under islamic tradition where men could divorce women by sayingi divorce you three times the arbitration councils were set up under the law in the urban and rural areas to deal with cases of a grant of sanction to a person to contract a second marriage during the subsistence of a marriage b reconciliation of a dispute between a husband and a wife c grant of a maintenance allowance to the wife and children industrialization and rural development through constructing modern national freeways are considered his greatest achievements and his era is remembered for successful industrialization in the impoverished country strong emphasis on capitalism and foreign direct investment fdi in the industry is often regarded as the great decade in the history of the country both economical and political history the decade of development was celebrated which highlighted the development plans executed during the years of ayubs rule the private consortium companies and industries and is credited with creating an environment where the private sector was encouraged to establish medium and smallscale industries in pakistan this opened up avenues for new job opportunities and thus the economic graph of the country started rising he oversaw the development and completion of mega projects such as hydroelectric dams power stations and barrages all over the country during 1960–66 the annual gdp growth was recorded at 68 several hydroelectric projects were completed including the mangla dam one of the worlds largest dams several small dams and water reservoirs in west pakistan and one dam in east pakistan the kaptai dam president ayub authorized planning of nuclear power plants overriding the concerns of his own finance minister muhammad shoaib about their cost initially two nuclear power plants were to be established in the country one in karachi and the other in dhaka dr abdus salam supported by the president personally approved the project in karachi while the project in east pakistan never materialized extensive education reforms were supposedly carried out and scientific development efforts were also supposedly made during his years these policies could not be sustained after 1965 when the economy collapsed and led to economic declines which he was unable to control ayub introduced new curricula and textbooks for universities and schools many publicsector universities and schools were built during his era  he also introduced agricultural reforms preventing anyone from occupying more than 500 acres of irrigated and 1000 acres of unirrigated land an oil refinery was established in karachi these reforms led to 15 gnp growth of the country that was three times greater than that of india despite the increase in the gnp growth the profit and revenue was gained by the famous 22 families of the time that controlled 66 of the industries and land of the country and 80 of the banking and insurance companies of pakistan during the ayub era the navy was able to introduce submarines and slowly modified itself by acquiring warships however ayub drastically reduced funding of the military in the 1950s and deprioritized nuclear weapons in the 1960s the military relied on donations from the united states for major weapons procurements major funding was made available for military acquisitions and procurement towards conventional weaponry for conventional defence in the 1960s the pakistani military acquired american‑produced conventional weapons such as jeep cjs m48 patton and m24 chaffee tanks m16 rifles f86 fighter airplanes and the submarine pns ghazi all through the us foreign military sales program in 1961 president ayub started the nations full‑fledged space program in cooperation with the air force and created the suparco civilian space agency that launched sounding rockets throughout the 1960s ayub directed pakistans nuclear technology efforts towards electrical power generation disregarding recommendations to use it for military purposes he reportedly spent ₨ 721 million on civilian nuclear power plants and related education of engineers and scientists ayub khan filled more and more civil administrative positions with army officers increasing the militarys influence over the bureaucracy he expanded the size of the army by more than half from the early 1960s to 1969 and maintained a high level of military spending as a percentage of gdp during that period peaking in the immediate aftermath of the indopakistani war of 1965 the main feature of ayub khans foreign policy was prioritized relations with the united states and europe foreign relations with the soviet union were downplayed he enjoyed support from president dwight eisenhower in the 1950s and working with prime minister ali khan forged a military alliance with the united states against regional communism his obsession towards modernization of the armed forces in the shortest time possible saw relations with the united states as the only way to achieve his organizational and personal objectives as he argued against civilian supremacy that would affect american interests in the region as a result of an election the central intelligence agency leased peshawar air station in the 1950s and spying into the soviet union from the air station grew immensely with ayubs full knowledge during his presidency  when these activities were exposed in 1960 after a u2 flying out of the air station was shot down and its pilot captured by the ussr president ayub was in the united kingdom on a state visit when the local cia station chief briefed president ayub on the incident ayub shrugged his shoulders and said that he had expected this would happen at some point the resulting soviet ire severely compromised the national security of pakistan ayub khan had to publicly offer his apologies to the soviet union after ussr secretary general nikita khrushchev made a threat to bomb peshawar president ayub directed his foreign office to reduce tensions with the soviet union by facilitating state visits by soviet premier kosygin and soviet foreign minister gromyko and agreeing to downplay relations with the united states in 1963 ayub signed the historic sinopakistan frontier agreement with china despite us opposition during 1961–65 ayub lost much of his support from president john kennedy and president lyndon johnson as they sought closer relations with india president johnson placed an embargo on both nations during the war in 1965 relations with the soviet union were eventually normalized when the soviets facilitated a peace treaty between pakistan and india in 1965 and reached a trade treaty with pakistan the following year in 1966–67 ayub wrestled with the united states attempt to dictate pakistans foreign policy while he strengthened relations with the soviet union and china despite initiatives to normalize relations with the soviet union ayub khan remained inclined towards the united states and the western world receiving president johnson in karachi in 1967 in 1961–62 ayub paid a state visit to the united kingdom  he attracted much attention from the british public when his involvement in the christine keeler affair was revealed in 1959 ayub khans interest in building defence forces had already diminished when he made an offer of joint defense with india during the sinoindo clashes in october 1959 in ladakh in a move seen as a result of american pressure and a lack of understanding of foreign affairs upon hearing this proposal indias prime minister nehru reportedly countered defence minister ayub joint defence on what\\u200a84–86\\u200a india remained uninterested in such proposals and prime minister nehru decided to push his countrys role in the nonaligned movement in 1960 president ayub together with prime minister nehru signed the indus waters treaty brokered by the world bank in 1962 after india was defeated by china ayub khan disguised a few thousand soldiers as guerillas and sent them to indian kashmir to incite the people to rebel in 1964 the pakistan army engaged with the indian army in several skirmishes and clandestine operations began the war with india in 1965 was a turning point in his presidency and it ended in a settlement reached by ayub khan at tashkent called the tashkent declaration which was facilitated by the soviet union the settlement was perceived negatively by many pakistanis and led foreign minister zulfiqar ali bhutto to resign his post and take up opposition to ayub khan according to morrice james for them pakistanis ayub had betrayed the nation and had inexcusably lost face before the indians according to sartaj aziz deputy chairman of the planning commission it was foreign minister bhutto who had inadvertently set pakistan on the road to war with india during a cabinet meeting bhutto had gone on a populist antiindian and antiamerican binge and succeeded in spellbinding president ayub into thinking he was becoming a world statesman fawned upon by the enemies of the united states when ayub authorized operation gibraltar the fomenting of an  kashmiri insurgency against india aziz famously told the president sir i hope you realize that our foreign policy and our economic requirements are not fully consistent in fact they are rapidly falling out of line aziz opposed operation gibraltar fearing the economical turmoil that would jolt the countrys economy but was in turn opposed by his own senior bureaucrats in that meeting foreign minister bhutto convinced the president and the finance minister muhammad shoaib that india would not attack pakistan due to kashmir being a disputed territory and per bhuttos remarks pakistans incursion into indianoccupied kashmir at akhnoor would not provide india with the justification for attacking pakistan across the international boundary because kashmir was a disputed territory this theory proved wrong when india launched a fullscale war against west pakistan in 1965 his army cinc general musa khan did not order the pakistan army to respond without the confirmation by president ayub khan despite foreign minister bhuttos urging  however after the indian army advanced towards the rann of kutch general musa khan ordered the army to respond against the opposing force he faced serious altercations with and public criticism from air chief am asghar khan for hiding the details of the war the air ahq began fighting the president over the contingency plans and this interservices rivalry ended with asghar khans resignation to reduce interservices tensions and criticism navy commander admiral a r khan authorised the shelling of coastal indian navy posts at dwarka indiaselfpublished source about the 1965 wars contingency plans am nur khan briefly wrote that rumours about an impending operation were rife but the army had not shared the plans with other forces ayub khans main sponsor the united states did not welcome the move and the johnson administration placed an economic embargo that caused pakistan to lose us500 million in aid and grants that had been received through consortium ayub khan could not politically survive in the aftermath of the 1965 war with india and fell from the presidency after surrendering presidential power to army commander general yahya in 1969citation needed afghanistan afghanistanpakistan confederation plan in the 1950s partly due to the complicated bilateral relations between afghanistan and pakistan over the durand line dispute ayub khan along with the royal family of afghanistan under king zahir shah proposed the afghanistanpakistan confederation plan to merge afghanistan with pakistan under a single confederation this merger was proposed on the basis of mutual distrust and fears of security threats by the indian government and the soviets which wasnt able to amount to fruition due to the eventual soviet invasion of afghanistan and the formation of a new communist afghan regime in 1964 president ayub khan was confident in his apparent popularity and saw the deep divisions within the political opposition which ultimately led him to announce presidential elections in 1965 he earned the nomination of the pakistan muslim league pml and was shocked when fatima jinnah was nominated by the combined opposition partiesbetter\\xa0source\\xa0needed fatima jinnah had gained a lot of support from karachi lahore and various parts of west and east pakistan opposed to president ayub khan jinnah targeted the indus waters treaty pakistans overreliance on the united states and its troubled relations with the soviet union during the elections president ayub earned notoriety when his son gohar ayub khan was named in the news media for authorizing political murders in karachi particularly of jinnah supporters angry protesters demonstrated in the streets of sindh chanting slogans against president ayub fatima jinnah won the popular vote in a landslide but ayub khan won the election through the electoral college vote during this time ayub khan used the pakistani intelligence community for his own advantage military intelligence actively monitored politicians and political gatherings and the intelligence bureau taped politicians telephone conversations this was the first departure of the intelligence community from national defence and security to direct interference with national politics an interference which continued in succeeding years it was reported that the elections were widely rigged by the state authorities and machinery under the control of ayub khan and it is believed that had the elections been held via direct ballot fatima jinnah would have won the electoral college consisted of only 80000 basic democrats they were easily manipulated by president ayub khan who won the bitterlycontested elections with 64 of the electoral college vote according to journalists of the time the election did not conform to international standards many viewed the election results with great suspicion the controversial victory over fatima jinnah in the 1965 presidential election and the outcome of the war with india in the same year brought devastating results for ayub khans image and his presidency khans foreign minister zulfikar ali bhutto believed the tashkent declaration was a political surrender which turned a military victory into defeat bhutto began criticizing ayub khan openly and resigned in june 1966 in karachi public resentment towards ayub had been rising since the 1965 elections and his policies were widely disapproved in 1967 bhutto formed the pakistan peoples party ppp and embarked on a nationwide tour where he attacked the ayub administrations economic religious and social policies the detention of bhutto further inflamed the opposition and demonstrations were sparked all over the country with the east pakistani awami league charging the ayub administration with discriminatory policies towards the east labour unions called for labour strikes against ayub khans labour legislation and dissatisfaction was widespread in the countrys middle class by the end of 1968 when ayub khan was confronted with the six point movement led by sheikh mujibur rahman and with the criticism by bhuttos ppp he responded by imprisoning both leaders but that made matters worse for ayubs administration leftwing parties allied with the conservative masses began advocating for the islamic parliamentary democracy system against his presidential rule in 1968 he survived an assassination attempt while visiting dacca and was visibly shaken afterwards according to close aides though this was not reported in the press of the day in 1969 ayub khan opened negotiations with the opposition parties in what was termed as a round table conference where he held talks with every opposition party except for the awami league and the pakistan peoples party  however these discussions yielded no results and strong antiayub demonstrations calling for his resignation were sparked all over the country during this time ayub khan survived a nearfatal cardiac arrest that put him out of the office and later survived a paralysis attack that put him in a wheelchair the police were unable to maintain law and order in the country especially in east pakistan where riots and a serious uprising were quelled at one point home and defence minister viceadmiral rahman told journalists that the country was under the mob rule and that police were not strong enough to tackle the situation the ppp also led very strong protests street demonstrations and riots against the ayub khans administration when the prices of food consumer products such as sugar tea and wheat hiked up disapproval of ayub khan was widely expressed by chanted slogans and insults referring to him on the streets of major cities of west pakistan massive wall chalkings that employed derogatory and pejorative terms for ayub made headlines in the print and broadcast media ayub khan himself was shocked upon hearing that young protesters and college students in west had been referring him to as dog according to a dawn editorial in 2014 it was the first time in the countrys history when derogatory language was used against its politicians elements in the military began supporting the opposition political parties it was this that finally brought about the demise of ayub khans era  on 25 march 1969 president ayub khan after consulting advocate raja muhammad qalib ali khan the last person to meet the president before resignation resigned from office and invited commanderinchief of the army general yahya khan to take over control of the country he was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution as a result for the first time in human history a world constituent assembly convened to draft and adopt a constitution for the federation of earth ayub khan did not comment on the bangladesh liberation war in 1971 he died of a heart attack on 19 april 1974 at his villa near islamabad ayub khans presidency allied pakistan with the americanled military alliance against the soviet union which helped pakistan develop its strong economic background and its longterm political and strategic relations with the united states major economic aid and trade from the united states and european communities ultimately led pakistans industrial sector to develop rapidly but the consequences of cartelization included increased inequality in the distribution of wealth after 1965 he became extremely concerned about the arrogance and bossiness of the us over the direction of pakistans foreign policy when the us publicly criticized pakistan for building ties with china and the soviet union he authored a book over this issue known as friends not masters ayub khan began his diary in september 1966 and ended his record in october 1972 because of his failing health the diary covers events such as his resignation from office the assumption of power by yahya khan the independence of bangladesh and the replacement of yahya by zulfikar ali bhutto after his death in 1972 the diary was not released to the public for thirty years due to opinions which would have been detrimental to the reputation of powerful individuals at the time ayub khan wanted his diary to be edited by his close associate altaf gauhar but after ayub khans death the sixyearlong diary was entrusted to oxford university press oup to edit and publish at oup diaries of field marshal mohammad ayub khan 19661972 was edited and annotated by american historian craig baxter the federal capital was relocated under the ayub administration from the port city of karachi to the new and carefully planned city of islamabad in the mountains facilitated by the world bank the ayub administration became a party to the indus waters treaty with archrival india to resolve disputes regarding the sharing of the waters of the six rivers in the punjab doab that flow between the two countries khans administration also built a major network of irrigation canals highwater dams and thermal and hydroelectric power stations he subsidized fertilizers and modernized agriculture through irrigation development and spurred industrial growth with liberal tax benefits in the decade of his rule the gnp rose by 45 and manufactured goods began to overtake such traditional exports as jute and cotton however the economists in the planning commission alleged that his policies were tailored to reward the elite families and major landowners in the country in 1968 his administration celebrated the socalled decade of development when the mass protests erupted all over the country due to an increasingly greater divide between the rich and the poor after 1965 the corruption in government nepotism and suppression of free speech thought and press increased unrest and turmoil in the country against the ayub administration the 1965 presidential election where ayub khan was opposed by fatima jinnah was allegedly rigged in 2003 the nephew of the quaidiazam akbar pirbhai reignited the controversy by suggesting that fatima jinnahs death in 1967 was an assassination by the ayub khan establishment gohar ayub khan became the subject of criticism by many writers when he was accused of leading a victory parade after the 1965 election right into the heartland of opposition territory in karachi in a blatantly provocative move the civil administrations failure to stop the rally led to fierce clashes between opposing groups with many locals being killed he was faced with allegations of widespread intentional vote riggings organizing political murders in karachi his peace with india was considered by many pakistanis an embarrassing compromise he is also blamed for not doing enough to tackle the significant economic disparity between east and west pakistan whilst he was aware of the acute grievances of east pakistan he did try to address the situation however the ayub khan regime was so highly centralized that in the absence of democratic institutions densely populated and politicized east pakistan province continued to feel it was being slighted author yasmin saikia argues that the islamization that is often blamed on muhammad ziaulhaq has its roots in the policies of ayub khan who injected a jihadi rhetoric into the pakistan army his rewriting of pakistans history from a purely islamic lenses and his categorization of bengali muslims as being too influenced by hinduism during his presidency differences between west and east pakistan arose to an enormous degree that ultimately led to the independence of bangladesh following the bangladesh liberation war gohar ayub khan also faced criticisms during that time on questions of family corruption and cronyism through his business links with his fatherinlaw retired lieutenant general habibullah khan khattak one western commentator in 1969 estimated gohar ayubs personal wealth at the time at 4 million while his familys wealth was put in the range of 10–20 million public criticism of gohars personal wealth and that of the president increased all these criticisms harmed president ayub khans imagecitation needed after his death his descendants became active in national politics in the 1990s until the present however these family members have been controversial his son gohar is an active member of the

seniors lieutenantgeneral altaf qadir and lieutenantgeneral bakhtiar rana back then he became pakistans youngest general at the age of 40 after becoming the commanderinchief of the army yahya energetically started reorganizing the pakistan army in 1966 the post1965 situation saw major organizational and technical changes in the pakistan army until 1965 it was thought that army divisions could function effectively while getting orders directly from the armys ghq this idea failed miserably in the 1965 war and the need to have intermediate corps headquarters in between the ghq and the fighting combat divisions was recognized as a foremost operational necessity after the 1965 war in the 1965 war the pakistan army had only one corps headquarters the 1 corps soon after the war had started the united states had imposed an embargo on military aid to both india and pakistan this embargo did not affect the indian army but produced major changes in the pakistan armys technical composition us secretary of state dean rusk well summed it up when he said well if you are going to fight go ahead and fight but were not going to pay for it pakistan now turned to china for military aid and the chinese tank t59 started replacing the us m4748 tanks as the pakistan armys mbt main battle tank from 1966 80 tanks the first batch of t59s a lowgrade version of the russian t5455 series were delivered to pakistan in 1965–66 the first batch was displayed in the joint services day parade on 23 march 1966 the 1965 war had proved that pakistan armys tankinfantry ratio was lopsided and more infantry was required three more infantry divisions 9 16 and 17 divisions largely equipped with chinese equipment and popularly referred to by the rank and file as the china divisions were raised by the beginning of 1968 two more corps headquarters the 2 corps headquarters jhelumravi corridor and the 4 corps headquarters ravisutlej corridor were raised also in east pakistan a corpssized formation which was titled as the eastern command was created a sustained antiregime mass movement began in the fall of 1968 in west pakistan the uprising spread to east pakistan and gathered strength president ayub khan tried to quell the revolt by making concessions to the opposition but demonstrations continued rather than resigning and allowing a constitutional transfer of power ayub khan requested that yahya khan commanderinchief of the army utilize the militarys supraconstitutional authority to declare martial law and take power on 25 march 1969 yahya did so when yahya khan assumed the office on 25 march 1969 he inherited a twodecade constitutional problem of interprovincial ethnic rivalry between the punjabipashtunmohajir dominated west pakistan and the ethnicallybengali muslim east pakistan in addition yahya also inherited an 11year problem of transforming a country essentially ruled by one man to a democratic country which was the ideological basis of the antiayub movement of 1968–69 as an army chief yahya had all the capabilities qualifications and potential but he inherited an extremelycomplex problem and was forced to perform the multiple roles of caretaker head of the country drafter of a provisional constitution resolving the one unit question satisfying the frustrations and the sense of exploitation and discrimination successively created in the east wing by a series of government policies since 1948 the american political scientist lawrence ziring observed\\xa0 yahya khan has been widely portrayed as a ruthless uncompromising insensitive and grossly inept leader while yahya cannot escape responsibility for these tragic events it is also on record that he did not act alone all the major actors of the period were creatures of a historic legacy and a psychopolitical milieu which did not lend itself to accommodation and compromise to bargaining and a reasonable settlement nurtured on conspiracy theories they were all conditioned to act in a manner that neglected agreeable solutions and promoted violent judgments yahya khan attempted to solve pakistans constitutional and interprovincialregional rivalry problems once he took over power from ayub khan in march 1969 the tragedy of the whole affair was the fact that all of the actions that yahya took were correct in principle but too late and served only to further intensify the political polarization between the east and west wings however the dissolution of one unit did not lead to the positive results that it might have occurred earlier yahya also made an attempt to accommodate the east pakistanis by abolishing the principle of parity in the hope that a greater share in the assembly would redress their wounded ethnic regional pride and ensure the integrity of pakistan instead of satisfying the bengalis it intensified their separatism since they felt that the west wing had politically suppressed them since 1958 which caused the rise of antiwest wing sentiment in the east wing in 1968 the political pressure exerted by zulfikar ali bhutto had weakened president ayub khan who had sacked bhutto for disagreeing with ayubs decision to implement on tashkent agreement facilitated by the soviet union to end the hostilities with india to ease the situation ayub had tried reaching out to terms with the major parties the pakistan peoples party ppp and the awami league al but remained unsuccessful in poor health president ayub abrogated his own constitution and suddenly resigned from the presidency on 24 march 1969 president ayub directed a letter to general yahya khan inviting him to deal with the situation as it was beyond the capacity of civil government to deal with the complex situation on 26 march 1969 general yahya appeared in national television and announced to enforce martial law in all over the country the 1962 constitution was abrogated the parliament was dissolved and ayubs civilian officials were dismissed in his first nationwide address yahya maintained i will not tolerate disorder let everyone remain at his post with immediate effect he installed a military government and featured active duty military officials yahya was well aware of this explosive situation and decided to bring changes all over the country his earlier initiatives directed towards establishing the national security council nsc with majorgeneral ghulam omar being its first advisor it was formed to analyse and prepare assessments towards issues relating the political and national security in 1969 president yahya also promulgated the legal framework order no 1970 which disestablished the one unit programme which had formed west pakistan instead it removed the prefix west but instead added pakistan the decree had no effect on east pakistan then yahya announced general elections to be held in 1970 and appointed judge abdus sattar as chief election commissioner of the election commission of pakistan the changes were carried out by president yahya khan to return the country towards parliamentary democracy by 28 july 1969 president yahya khan had set a framework for elections that were to be held in december 1970 finally the general elections were held all over the country in east pakistan the awami league led by sheikh mujibur rahman held almost all seats but no seat in any of four provinces of west pakistan the socialist pakistan peoples party ppp had won the exclusive mandate in the four provinces of pakistan but none in east pakistan the pakistan muslim league pml led by nurul amin was the only party to have representation from all over the country but it had failed to gain the mandate to run the government the awami league had 160 seats all won from east pakistan the socialist ppp 81 and the conservative pml 10 in the national assembly the general electionss results truly reflected the ugly political reality the division of the pakistani electorate along regional lines and political polarisation of the country between east pakistan and west pakistan in political terms therefore pakistan as a nation stood divided as a result a series of bilateral talks between ppp and mujibur rahman produced no results and were unable to come to an agreement of from west pakistan to east pakistans representatives on the basis of the sixpoint programme in pakistan the people had felt that the sixpoint programme was a step towards the secession from pakistan while the political deadlock remained between the awami league ppp and the military government after the general elections in 1970 yahya khan began coordinating several meetings with his military strategists over the issue in east pakistan on 25 march 1971 yahya initiated operation searchlight a genocidal crackdown to suppress bengali dissent the situation in east pakistan worsened and the gulf between the two wings had become too wide to be bridged as a result of operation searchlight agitation was now transformed into civil war as bengali members of pakistan armed forces and police mutinied and formed the mukti bahini along with common people of all classes to launch unconventional and hitandrun operations violent disorder and chaos followed after the pakistan army continued its systematic and deliberate campaign of killing and mass rape of the populace of east pakistan both yahya khan and bhutto flew to dhaka and tried negotiations one more time but they did not succeed and reached a deadlock operation searchlight was a genocidal military operation carried out by the pakistan armed forces to curb the bengali nationalist movement in erstwhile east pakistan in march 1971 ordered by the government in pakistan it was seen as the sequel to operation blitz which had been launched in november 1970 the pakistani governments view was that it had to launch a campaign to neutralise a rebellion in east pakistan to save the unity of pakistan sheikh mujibur rahman proclaimed the independent state of bangladesh and a governmentinexile the original plan envisioned taking control of the major cities on 26 march 1971 and then eliminating all opposition political or military within one month the prolonged bengali resistance had not been anticipated by pakistani planners the main phase of operation searchlight ended with the fall of the last major town in bengali hands in midmay the total number of people killed in east pakistan is not known with any degree of accuracy bangladeshi authorities claim that 3 million people were killed while the hamoodur rahman commission an official pakistani government investigation put the figure as low as 26000 civilian casualties in her widely discredited book dead reckoning memories of the 1971 bangladesh war sarmila bose said between 50000 and 100000 combatants and civilians were killed by both sides during the war a 2008 british medical journal study by ziad obermeyer christopher j l murray and emmanuela gakidou estimated that up to 269000 civilians died as a result of the conflict the authors note that this is far higher than a previous estimate of 58000 from uppsala university and the peace research institute oslo general yahya khan arrested sheikh mujibur rahman on charges of sedition and appointed brigadier rahimuddin khan later general to preside over a special tribunal dealing with mujibs case rahimuddin awarded mujib the death sentence and president yahya put the verdict into abeyance yahyas crackdown however had led to the bangladesh liberation war within pakistan with india being drawn into the war india fighting on behalf of the bangladeshis against pakistan a war which would later extend into the indopak war of 1971 the aftermaths of this war were mainly that east pakistan became independent as bangladesh and india captured approximately 15000 square kilometres 5000 square miles of land of west pakistan now pakistan however the captured territory of west pakistan was given back to pakistan in the simla agreement signed later on 2 july 1972 between indira gandhi and zulfiqar ali bhutto the 1971 war led to increased tensions between the countries but nonetheless pakistan recognised the independence of bangladesh after severe pressure from the oic but this event led to high tensions between pakistan and india the united states had been a major sponsor of president yahyas military government american journalist gary bass notes in the blood telegram nixon kissinger and a forgotten genocide nixon liked very few people but he did like general agha muhammad yahya khan personal initiatives of president yahya had helped to establish the communication channel between the united states and china which would be used to set up the nixons trip in 1972 since 1960 pakistan was perceived in the united states as an integral bulwark against global communism in the cold war the united states cautiously supported pakistan during 1971 although congress kept in place an arms embargo in 1970 india with a heavily socialist economy entered in a formal alliance with the soviet union in august 1971 nixon urged president yahya khan multiple times to exercise restraint his objective was to prevent a war and safeguard pakistans interests though he feared an indian invasion of pakistan that would lead to indian domination of the subcontinent and strengthen the position of the soviet union similarly president yahya feared that an independent bangladesh could lead to the disintegration of pakistan indian military support for bengali guerrillas led to war between india and pakistan in november 1971 indian prime minister indira gandhi met nixon in washington she assured him that she didnt want war with pakistan but he did not believe her witness accounts presented by kissinger pointed out that nixon made specific proposals to prime minister gandhi on a solution for the crisis some of which she heard for the first time including a mutual withdrawal of troops from the indoeast pakistan borders nixon also expressed a wish to fix a time limit with yahya for political accommodation in east pakistan nixon asserted that india could count on us endeavors to ease the crisis within a short time but both kissinger and gandhis aide jayakar maintained gandhi did not respond to these proposals kissinger noted that she listened to what was in fact one of nixons better presentations with aloof indifference but took up none of the points jayakar pointed out that gandhi listened to nixon without a single comment creating an impregnable space so that no real contact was possible she also refrained from assuring that india would follow pakistans suit if it withdrew from indias borders as a result the main agenda was dropped altogether on 3 december 1971 yahya preemptively attacked the indian air force and gandhi retaliated pushing into east pakistan nixon issued a statement blaming pakistan for starting the conflict and blaming india for escalating it he favored a ceasefire the united states was secretly encouraging the shipment of military equipment from iran turkey and jordan to pakistan offering to later replenish those countries weapons stocks despite congressional objections the us used the threat of an aid cutoff to force pakistan to back down while its continued military aid to islamabad prevented india from launching incursions deeper into the country pakistan forces in east pakistan surrendered on 16 december 1971 leading to the creation of the independent state of bangladesh when the news of the surrender of pakistan reached through the national television the spontaneous and overwhelming public anger over pakistans defeat by bangladeshi rebels and the indian army followed by the division of pakistan into two parts boiled into street demonstrations throughout pakistan rumors of an impending coup détat by junior military officers against president yahya khan swept the country yahya became the highestranking casualty of the war to forestall further unrest on 20 december 1971 he handed over the presidency and government to zulfikar ali bhutto— the ambitious leader of pakistans powerful and popular at that time peoples party within hours of yahya stepping down president bhutto reversed judge advocate general branch pakistans verdict against sheikh mujibur rahman and instead released him to see him off to london president bhutto also signed orders for yahyas house confinement the man who imprisoned mujib in the first place both actions produced headlines around the world he was nominally a shia muslim but was nonpractising and was known to have indulged in activities prohibited in islam such as womanizing and the consumption of alcohol towards the end of his life during and following his imprisonment yahya slowly abandoned drinking altogether as he turned extremely religious yahya is said to have had a relationship with akleem akhtar nicknamed general rani but he was never married his name was linked with the singer and actress noor jehan as well he also had a brief relationship with a bengali woman called mrs shamim k hussain also known as black beauty the wife of a police officer yahya appreciated her company not so much for her looks but mainly because she was fluent in english and could talk about shakespeare and lord byron among his favourite poets and she eventually became influential enough to shape the decisions of the foreign office indian journalist dewan berindranath argued that yahya turned to alcohol and womanizing when he gained power as a coping mechanism to deal with stress and that when he was a soldier he was known for being morally upright abstaining from partying unlike other officers and instead preferring to spend time with his family and also practicing islamic rituals such as the fast of ramadan eventually quoting ayub khan who said that give me half a dozen officers of the calibre and moral standards of yahya khan and i can show you what can pakistan do as a great nation of the islamic world yahya had a son named ali khan and a daughter named yasmina khan his elder brother agha muhammad ali khan worked in the police among other postings being the senior superintendent of police ssp lahore from 1948 to 1951 his nephew ahmed ali was also in the pakistan army as a captain and then as a major serving as yahyas

down his memoirs in the form of notes that remain unpublished he died on 10 august 1980 in rawalpindi punjab and was interred at circle road graveyard peshawar pakistan yahya khan was awarded hpk hj spk nepl but then stripped of his service honours by pakistan khan is viewed largely negatively by pakistani historians and is considered among the worst of the countrys leaders his rule is widely regarded as the leading cause of the breakup of pakistan in the united states he has been appreciated for facilitating the american opening to china president richard nixon sending a handwritten letter to him stating that without your personal assistance the profound breakthrough in relations between the usa and the peoples republic of china would never have been accomplished those who want a more peaceful world in the generations to come will be forever in your debt pervez musharrafa 11 august 1943 – 5 february 2023 was a pakistani army general and politician who served as the tenth

issues also recommended a neutral but competent bureaucracy and administration of at federal level and the establishment of local governments in four provinces this proposal was met with hostility and led to nawaz sharifs dismissal of general karamat in turn this reduced nawazs mandate in public circles and led to much criticism from leader of the opposition benazir bhutto there were three lieutenantgenerals potentially in line to succeed general karamat as chief of army staff lieutenantgeneral ali kuli khan a graduate of pma and rma sandhurst was an extremely capable staff officer and wellliked in public circles but was seen as close to the former chief of army staff general retired abdul waheed kakar and was not promoted second in line was lieutenantgeneral khalid nawaz khan who

prime minister nawaz sharif personally promoted musharraf to the rank of fourstar general to replace karamat after the kargil incident musharraf did not wish to be the chairman of the joint chiefs musharraf favoured the chief of naval staff admiral bokhari to take on this role and claimed that he did not care prime minister sharif was displeased by this suggestion due to the hostile nature of his relationship with the admiral musharraf further exacerbated his divide with nawaz sharif after recommending the forced retirement of senior officers close to the prime minister including lieutenantgeneral tariq pervez also known by his names initials as tp commander of xii corps who was a brotherinlaw of a high profile cabinet minister according to musharraf lieutenantgeneral tp was an illmannered foulmouthed illdisciplined officer who caused a great deal of dissent within the armed forces nawaz sharifs announcement of the promotion of general musharraf to chairman joint chiefs caused an escalation of the tensions with admiral bokhari upon hearing the news he launched a strong protest against the prime minister the next morning the prime minister relieved admiral bokhari of his duties it was during his time as chairman of the joint chiefs that musharraf began to build friendly relations with the united states army establishment including general anthony zinni usmc general tommy franks general john abizaid and general colin powell of the us army all of whom were premier fourstar generals the pakistan army originally conceived the kargil plan after the siachen conflict but the plan was rebuffed repeatedly by senior civilian and military officials musharraf was a leading strategist behind the kargil conflict from march to may 1999 he ordered secret infiltration of forces into the kargil district after india discovered the infiltration a fierce indian offensive nearly led to a fullscale war however sharif withdrew support for the insurgents in july because of heightened international pressure sharifs decision antagonised the pakistan army and rumours of a possible coup began emerging soon afterward sharif and musharraf dispute on who was responsible for the kargil conflict and pakistans withdrawal this strategic operation met with great hostility in the public circles and wide scale disapproval in the media who roundly criticised this operation musharraf had severe confrontation and became involved in serious altercations with his senior officers chief of naval staff admiral fasih bokhari chief of air staff air chief marshal pq mehdi and senior lieutenantgeneral ali kuli khan admiral bokhari ultimately demanded a fullfledged jointservice court martial against general musharraf while on the other hand general kuli khan lambasted the war as a disaster bigger than the eastpakistan tragedy adding that the plan was flawed in terms of its conception tactical planning and execution that ended in sacrificing so many soldiers problems with his lifelong friend chief of air staff air chief marshal pervez mehdi also arose when air chief refrained to participate or authorise any air strike to support the elements of army operations in the kargil region during the last meeting with the prime minister musharraf faced grave criticism on results produced by kargil infiltration by the principal military intelligence mi director lieutenantgeneral jamshed gulzar kiani who maintained in the meeting  whatever has been written there is against logic if you catch your enemy by the jugular vein he would react with full force if you cut enemy supply lines the only option for him will be to ensure supplies by air sic at that situation the indian army was unlikely to confront and it had to come up to the occasion it is against wisdom that you dictate to the enemy to keep the war limited to a certain front nawaz sharif has maintained that the operation was conducted without his knowledge however details of the briefing he got from the military before and after the kargil operation have become public before the operation between january and march sharif was briefed about the operation in three separate meetings in january the army briefed him about the indian troop movement along the loc in skardu on 29 january 1999 on 5 february at kel on 12 march at the ghq and finally on 17 may at the isi headquarters during the end of the june dcc meeting a tense sharif turned to the army chief and said you should have told me earlier musharraf pulled out his notebook and repeated the dates and contents of around seven briefings he had given him since the beginning of january military officials from musharrafs joint staff headquarters js hq met with regional corps commanders three times in late september in anticipation of a possible coup to quieten rumours of a fallout between musharraf and sharif sharif officially certified musharrafs remaining two years of his term on 30 september musharraf had left for a weekend trip to take part in sri lankas armys 50thanniversary celebrations when pervez musharraf was returning from an official visit to colombo his flight was denied landing permissions to karachi international airport after orders were issued from the prime ministers office upon hearing the announcement of nawaz sharif replacing pervez musharraf by khwaja ziauddin the third replacement of the top military commander of the country in less than two years local military commanders began to mobilise troops towards islamabad from nearby rawalpindi the military placed sharif under house arrest but in a lastditch effort sharif privately ordered karachi air traffic controllers to redirect musharrafs flight to india the plan failed after soldiers in karachi surrounded the airport control tower at 250\\xa0am on 13 october musharraf addressed the nation with a recorded message musharraf met with president rafiq tarar on 13 october to deliberate on legitimising the coup on 15 october musharraf ended emerging hopes of a quick transition to democracy after he declared a state of emergency suspended the constitution and assumed power as chief executive he also

obtain the office of the prime minister the prime ministers secretariat official residence of prime minister of pakistan was closed by the military police and its staff was fired by musharraf immediately there were no organised protests within the country to the coup that was widely criticised by the international community consequently pakistan was suspended from the commonwealth of nations sharif was put under house arrest and later exiled to saudi arabia on his personal request and under a contract the senior military appointments in the interservices were extremely important

made by musharraf in the navy although admiral aziz mirza a lifelong friend of musharraf he shared a dorm with the admiral in the 1960s and they graduated together from the academy was appointed by prime minister nawaz sharif mirza remained extremely supportive of musharrafs coup and was also a close friend of musharraf since 1971 when both participated in a joint operation against the indian army after mirzas retirement musharraf appointed admiral shahid karimullah with whom musharraf had trained together in special forces schools during the 1960s to fourstar rank and chief of naval staff

finance minister and abdul sattar as foreign minister in early november he released details of his assets to the public in late december 1999 musharraf dealt with his first international crisis when india accused pakistans involvement in the indian airlines flight 814 hijacking though united states president bill clinton pressured musharraf to ban the alleged group behind the hijacking — harkatulmujahideen pakistani officials refused because of fears of reprisal from political parties such as jamaateislami in march 2000 musharraf banned political rallies in a television interview given in 2001 musharraf openly spoke about the negative role of a few highranking officers in the pakistan armed forces in states affairs musharraf labelled many of his senior professors at ndu as

under house arrest at a government guesthouse and opened his lahore home to the public in late october 1999 he was formally indicted in november on charges of hijacking kidnapping attempted murder and treason for preventing musharrafs flight from landing at karachi airport on the day of the coup his trial began in early march 2000 in an antiterrorism court which is designed for speedy trials he testified musharraf began preparations of a coup after the kargil conflict sharif was placed in adiala jail infamous for hosting zulfikar ali bhuttos trial and his leading defence lawyer iqbal raad was shot dead in karachi in midmarch sharifs defence team blamed the military for intentionally providing their lawyers with inadequate protection the court proceedings were widely accused of being a show trial sources from pakistan claimed that musharraf and his military governments officers were in full mood to exercise tough conditions on sharif and intended to send nawaz sharif to the gallows to face a similar fate to that of zulfikar ali bhutto in 1979 it was the pressure on musharraf exerted by saudi arabia and the united states to exile sharif after it was confirmed that the court is about to give its verdict on nawaz sharif over treason charges and the court would sentence sharif to death sharif signed an agreement with musharraf and his military government and his family was

of pakistan musharraf was the first military president to accept the rulings of the supreme court and holding free and fair elections in 2002 part of his vision to return democratic rule to the country in october 2002 pakistan held general elections which the promusharraf pmlq won wide margins although it had failed to gain an absolute majority the pmlq formed a government with farright religious parties coalition the mma and the liberals mqm the coalition legitimised musharrafs rule after the elections the pmlq nominated zafarullah khan jamali for the office of prime minister which musharraf also approved after first session at the parliament musharraf voluntarily transferred the powers of chief executive to prime minister zafarullah khan jamali musharraf succeeded to pass the xvii amendment which grants powers to dissolve the parliament with approval required from the supreme court within two years jamali proved to be an ineffective prime minister as he forcefully implemented his policies in the country and caused problems with the business class elites musharraf accepted the resignation of jamali and asked his close colleague chaudhry shujaat hussain to appoint a new prime minister in place hussain nominated finance minister shaukat aziz who had been impressive due to his performance as finance minister in 1999 musharraf regarded aziz as his right hand and preferable choice for the office of prime minister with aziz appointed as prime minister musharraf transferred all executive powers to aziz as he trusted shaukat aziz aziz proved to be extremely capable in running the government under his leadership economic growth reached to a maximum level which further stabilised musharrafs presidency aziz swiftly quietly and quickly undermined the elements seeking to undermine musharraf which became a factor in musharrafs trust in him between 2004 and 2007 aziz approved many projects that did not require musharrafs permission in 2010 all constitutional changes carried out by musharraf and azizs policies were reverted by the 18th amendment which restored the powers of the prime minister and reduced the role of the president to levels below that of even the premusharraf era he suspended the countrys democratic process and imposed two states of emergency leading to his conviction for treason during his rule he implemented both liberal reforms and authoritarian measures while also forming alliances and impacting the situation in balochistan the legacy of musharrafs era serves as a cautionary tale for future leaders in pakistan the president musharraf stood clapping his hands right next to us as we sang azadi and jazba and moved to the beat with us it was such a relief to have a coolest leader in the office the presidency of pervez musharraf helped bring the liberal forces to the national level and into prominence for the first time in the history of pakistan he granted national amnesty to the political workers of the liberal parties like muttahida qaumi movement and pakistan muslim league q and supported mqm in becoming a central player in the government musharraf disbanded the cultural policies of the previous prime minister nawaz sharif and quickly adopted benazir bhuttos cultural policies after disbanding indian channels in the country his cultural policies liberalised pakistans media and he issued many television licences to the privatesector to open television centres and media houses the television dramas film industry theatre music and literature activities were personally encouraged by pervez musharraf under his policies the rock music bands gained a following in the country and many concerts were held each week his cultural policies the film theatre rock and folk music and television programs were extremely devoted to and promoted the national spirit of the country in 2001 musharraf got on stage with the rock music band junoon and sang the national song with the band on political fronts musharraf faced fierce opposition from the ultraconservative alliance the mma led by clergyman maulana noorani in pakistan maulana noorani was remembered as a mystic religious leader and had preached spiritual aspects of islam all over the world as part of the world islamic mission although the political deadlock posed by maulana noorani was neutralised after nooranis death musharraf yet had to face the opposition from ard led by benazir bhutto of the ppp on 18 september 2005 musharraf made a speech before a broad based audience of jewish leadership sponsored by the american jewish congresss council for world jewry in new york city he was widely criticised by middle eastern leaders but was met with some praise among jewish leadership musharraf allied with the united states against the taliban in afghanistan after the september 11 attacks as the closest state to the taliban government musharraf was in negotiations with them in the aftermath of the attacks regarding the severity of the situation before allying with the us and declaring to stamp out extremism he was however criticised by nato and the afghan government of not doing enough to prevent pro taliban or alqaeda militants in the pakistanafghanistan border region tensions with afghanistan increased in 2006 with hamid karzai then president of afghanistan accusing musharraf of failing to act against afghan taliban leaders in pakistan claiming that the taliban leader mullah omar was based in quetta pakistan in response musharraf hit back saying none of this is true and karzai knows it george w bush encouraged the two leaders to unite in the war on terror during a trio meeting violence in the khyber pakhtunkhwa escalated in the late 2000s amid fighting between militants and pakistani soldiers backed by the us after the 2001 gujarat earthquake musharraf expressed his sympathies to indian prime minister atal bihari vajpayee and sent a plane load of relief supplies to india in 2004 musharraf began a series of talks with india to resolve the kashmir dispute in 2004 a ceasefire was agreed upon along the line of control many troops still patrol the border in 2006 king abdullah of saudi arabia visited pakistan for the first time as king musharraf honoured king abdullah with the nishanepakistan musharraf received the king abdulaziz medallion in 2007 from september 2001 until his resignation in 2007 from the military musharrafs presidency was affected by scandals relating to nuclear weapons which were detrimental to his authoritative legitimacy in the country and in the international community in october 2001 musharraf authorised a sting operation led by fia to arrest two physicists sultan bashiruddin mahmood and chaudhry abdul majeed because of their supposed connection with the taliban after they secretly visited talibancontrolled afghanistan in 2000 the local pakistani media widely circulated the reports that mahmood had a meeting with osama bin laden where bin laden had shown interest in building a radiological weapon it was later discovered that neither scientist had any indepth knowledge of the technology in december 2001 musharraf authorised security hearings and the two scientists were taken into the custody by the jag branch jag security hearings continued until early 2002 another scandal arose as a consequence of disclosure by pakistani nuclear physicist abdul qadeer khan on 27 february 2001 musharraf spoke highly of khan at a state dinner in islamabad and he personally approved khans appointment as science advisor to the government in 2004 musharraf relieved abdul qadeer khan from his post and initially denied knowledge of the governments involvement in nuclear proliferation despite khans claim that musharraf was the big boss of the proliferation ring following this musharraf authorised a national security hearing which continued until his resignation from the army in 2007 according to zahid malik musharraf and the military establishment at that time acted against abdul qadeer khan in an attempt to prove the loyalty of pakistan to the united states and western world the investigations backfired on musharraf and public opinion turned against him the populist ard movement which included the major political parties such as the pml and the ppp used the issue to bring down musharrafs presidency the debriefing of abdul qadeer khan severely damaged musharrafs own public image and his political prestige in the country he faced bitter domestic criticism for attempting to vilify khan specifically from opposition leader benazir bhutto in an interview to daily times bhutto maintained that khan had been a scapegoat in the nuclear proliferation scandal and said that she didnt believe that such a big scandal could have taken place under the nose of general musharraf musharrafs longstanding ally the mqm published criticism of musharraf over his handling of abdul qadeer khan the ard movement and the political parties further tapped into the public anger and mass demonstrations against musharraf the credibility of the united states was also badly damaged the us itself refrained from pressuring musharraf to take further action against khan while abdul qadeer khan remained popular in the country musharraf could not withstand the political pressure and his presidency was further weakened musharraf quickly pardoned abdul qadeer khan in exchange for cooperation and issued confinement orders against khan that limited khans movement he handed over the case of abdul qadeer khan to prime minister aziz who had been supportive towards khan personally thanking him the services of dr qadeer khan are unforgettable for the country on 4 july 2008 in an interview abdul qadeer khan laid the blame on president musharraf and later on benazir bhutto for transferring the technology claiming that musharraf was aware of all the deals and he was the big boss for those deals khan said that musharraf gave centrifuges to north korea in a 2000 shipment supervised by the armed forces the equipment was sent in a north korean plane loaded under the supervision of pakistan security officials nuclear weapons expert david albright of the institute for science and international security agreed that khans activities were governmentsanctioned after musharrafs resignation abdul qadeer khan was released from house arrest by the executive order of the supreme court of pakistan after musharraf left the country the new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee general tärik majid terminated all further debriefings of abdul qadeer khan few believed that abdul qadeer khan acted alone and the affair risked gravely damaging the armed forces which oversaw and controlled the nuclear weapons development and of which musharraf was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff until his resignation from military service on 28 november 2007 when musharraf came to power in 1999 he promised that the corruption in the government bureaucracy would be cleaned up however some claimed that the level of corruption did not diminish throughout musharrafs time musharraf instituted prohibitions on foreign students access to studying islam within pakistan an effort that began as an outright ban but was later reduced to restrictions on obtaining visas in december 2003 musharraf made a deal with mma a sixmember coalition of hardline islamist parties agreeing to leave the army by 31 december 2004 with that partys support promusharraf legislators were able to muster the twothirds supermajority required to pass the seventeenth amendment which retroactively legalised musharrafs 1999 coup and many of his decrees musharraf reneged on his agreement with the mma and promusharraf legislators in the parliament passed a bill allowing musharraf to keep both offices on 1 january 2004 musharraf had won a confidence vote in the electoral college of pakistan consisting of both houses of parliament and the four provincial assemblies musharraf received 658 out of 1170 votes a 56 majority but many opposition and islamic members of parliament walked out to protest the vote as a result of this vote his term was extended to 2007 prime minister zafarullah khan jamali resigned on 26 june 2004 after losing the support of musharrafs party pmlq his resignation was at least partially due to his public differences with the party chairman chaudhry shujaat hussain this was rumoured to have happened at musharrafs command jamali had been appointed with the support of musharrafs and the promusharraf pmlq most pmlq parliamentarians formerly belonged to the pakistan muslim league party led by sharif and most ministers of the cabinet were formerly senior members of other parties joining the pmlq after

womens protection bill on 1 december 2006 the bill places rape laws under the penal code and allegedly does away with harsh conditions that previously required victims to produce four male witnesses and exposed the victims to prosecution for adultery if they were unable to prove the crime\\nhowever the womens protection bill has been criticised heavily by many for paying continued lip service and failing to address the actual problem by its roots repealing the hudood ordinance in this context musharraf has also been criticised by women and human rights activists for not following up his words by action the human rights commission of pakistan hrcp said that the socalled womens protection bill is a farcical attempt at making hudood ordinances palatable outlining the issues of the bill and the continued impact on women his government increased reserved seats for women in assemblies to increase womens representation and make their presence more effective the number of reserved seats in the national assembly was increased from 20 to 60 in provincial assemblies 128 seats were reserved for women this situation has brought out increase participation of women in the 1988 and 2008

pronouncing captain hammad a fellow military man and the accused in the case innocent before the judicial inquiry was complete shazia alleged that she was forced by the government to leave the country in an interview given to the washington post in september 2005 musharraf said that pakistani women who had been the victims of rape treated rape as a moneymaking concern and were only interested in the publicity to make money and get a canadian visa he subsequently denied making these comments but the post made available an audio recording of the interview in which musharraf could be heard making the quoted remarks musharraf also denied mukhtaran mai a pakistani rape victim the right to travel abroad until pressured by us state department the remarks made by musharraf sparked outrage

did not support indian involvement in world war i and stayed in close touch with muslim political leaders such as mohammad ali jouhar and muhammad ali jinnah he was a critic of the mainstream indian

jinnah was a political leader capable of preserving unity and fulfilling the leagues objectives of muslim political empowerment building a strong personal correspondence with jinnah iqbal was influential in convincing jinnah to end his selfimposed exile in london return to india and take charge of the league iqbal firmly believed that jinnah was the only leader capable of drawing indian muslims to the league and maintaining party unity before the british and the congress i know you are a busy man but i do hope you wont mind my writing to you often as you are the only muslim in india today to whom the community has the right to look up for safe guidance through the storm which is coming to northwest india and perhaps to the whole of india while iqbal espoused the idea of muslimmajority provinces in 1930 jinnah would continue to hold talks with the congress through the decade and only officially embraced the goal of pakistan in 1940 some historians postulate that jinnah always remained hopeful for an agreement with the congress and never fully desired the partition of india iqbals close correspondence with jinnah is speculated by some historians as having been responsible for jinnahs embrace of the idea of pakistan iqbal elucidated to jinnah his vision of a separate muslim state in a letter sent on 21 june 1937 a separate federation of muslim provinces reformed on the lines i have suggested above is the only course by which we can secure a peaceful india and save muslims from the domination of nonmuslims why should not the muslims of northwest india and bengal be considered as nations entitled to selfdetermination just as other nations in india and outside india are iqbal serving as president of the punjab muslim league criticised jinnahs political actions including a political agreement with punjabi leader sikandar hyat khan whom iqbal saw as a representative of feudal classes and not committed to islam as the core political philosophy nevertheless iqbal worked constantly to encourage muslim leaders and masses to support jinnah and the league speaking about the political future of muslims in india iqbal said there is only one way out muslims should strengthen jinnahs hands they should join the muslim league indian question as is now being solved can be countered by our united front against both the hindus and the english without it our demands are not going to be accepted people say our demands smack of communalism this is sheer propaganda these demands relate to the defense of our national existence the united front can be formed under the leadership of the muslim league and the muslim league can succeed only on account of jinnah now none but jinnah is capable of leading the muslims a famous debate was held between iqbal and hussain ahmed madani on the question of nationalism in the late 1930s madanis position throughout was to insist on the islamic legitimacy of embracing a culturally plural secular democracy as the best and the only realistic future for indias muslims where iqbal insisted on a religiously defined homogeneous muslim society madani and iqbal both appreciated this point and they never advocated the creation of an absolute islamic state they differed only in their first step according to madani the first step was the freedom of india for which composite nationalism was necessary according to iqbal the first step was the creation of a community of muslims in the muslim majority land ie a muslim india within india iqbals six english lectures were published in lahore in 1930 and then by the oxford university press in 1934 in the book the reconstruction of religious thought in islam the lectures had been delivered at madras hyderabad and aligarh these lectures dwell on the role of islam as a religion and as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age in these lectures iqbal firmly rejects the political attitudes and conduct of muslim politicians whom he saw as morally misguided attached to power and without any standing with the muslim massescitation needed iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism weaken the spiritual foundations of islam and muslim society but that indias hindumajority population would crowd out muslim heritage culture and political influence in his travels to egypt afghanistan iran and turkey he promoted ideas of greater islamic political cooperation and unity calling for the shedding of nationalist differences he also speculated on different political arrangements to guarantee muslim political power in a dialogue with dr b r ambedkar iqbal expressed his desire to see indian provinces as autonomous units under the direct control of the british government and with no central indian government he envisaged autonomous muslim regions in india under a single indian union he feared for muslims who would suffer in many respects especially concerning their existentially separate entity as muslims iqbal was elected president of the muslim league in 1930 at its session in allahabad in the united provinces as well as for the session in lahore in 1932 in his presidential address on 29 december 1930 he outlined a vision of an independent state for muslimmajority provinces in northwestern india i would like to see the punjab northwest frontier province sind and baluchistan amalgamated into a single state selfgovernment within the british empire or without the british empire the formation of a consolidated northwest indian muslim state appears to me to be the final destiny of the muslims at least of northwest india in his speech iqbal emphasised that unlike christianity islam came with legal concepts with civic significance with its religious ideals considered as inseparable from social order therefore if it means a displacement of the islamic principle of solidarity the construction of a policy on national lines is simply unthinkable to a muslim iqbal thus stressed not only the need for the political unity of muslim communities but the undesirability of blending the muslim population into a wider society not based on islamic principlescitation needed the latter part of iqbals life was concentrated on political activity he travelled across europe and west asia to garner political and financial support for the league he reiterated the ideas of his 1932 address and during the third round table conference he opposed the congress and proposals for transfer of power without considerable autonomy or independence for muslim provincescitation needed he would serve as president of the punjab muslim league and would deliver speeches and publish articles in an attempt to rally muslims across india as a single political entity iqbal consistently criticised feudal classes in punjab as well as muslim politicians opposed to the league many accounts of iqbals frustration toward congress leadership were also pivotal in providing a vision for the twonation theory

was said by iqbal to be present in adam for which god ordered all of the angels to prostrate in front of adam iqbal condemns selfdestruction for him the aim of life is selfrealization and selfknowledge he charts the stages through which the self has to pass before finally arriving at its point of perfection enabling the knower of the self to become a viceregent of god in his

asserts but once this is achieved he should sacrifice his ambitions for the needs of the nation man cannot realise the self outside of society published in 1917 this group of poems has as its main themes the ideal community islamic ethical and social principles and the relationship between the individual and society although he supports islam iqbal also recognises the positive aspects of other

follows the examples of the works of ibn arabi and dantes the divine comedy through mystical and exaggerated depictions across time iqbal depicts himself as zinda rud a stream full of life guided by rumi the master through various heavens and spheres and has the honour of approaching divinity and coming in contact with divine illuminations in a passage reliving a historical period iqbal condemns

shakkar ast طرز گفتار دري شيرين تر است tarzi guftari dari shirin tar ast translation even though in sweetness hindi archaic name for urdu lit language of india is sugar – but speech method in dari the

heritage of islam and the muslim community with a global perspective iqbal urges the entire muslim community addressed as the ummah to define personal social and political existence by the values and teachings of islam iqbals works were in persian for most of his career but after 1930 his works were mainly in urdu his works in this period were often specifically directed at the muslim masses of

religious passion zarbikalim ضربِ کلیم or the rod of moses is another philosophical poetry book of allama iqbal in urdu it was published in 1936 two years before his death in which he described as his political manifesto it was published with the subtitle a declaration of war against the present times muhammad iqbal argues that modern problems are due to the godlessness materialism and injustice of modern civilisation which feeds on the subjugation and exploitation of weak nations especially the indian muslims iqbals final work was armughanehijaz ارمغانِ حجاز the gift of hijaz published posthumously in 1938 the first part contains quatrains in persian and the second part contains some poems and epigrams in urdu the persian quatrains convey the impression that the poet is travelling through the hijaz in his imagination the profundity of ideas and intensity of passion are the salient features of these short poems iqbals vision of mystical experience is clear in one of his urdu ghazals which was written in london during his student days some verses of that ghazal are at last the silent tongue of hijaz has announced to the ardent ear the tiding\\nthat the covenant which had been given to the\\ndesertdwellers is going to be renewed\\nvigorously\\nthe lion who had emerged from the desert and\\nhad toppled the roman empire is\\nas i am told by the angels about to get

and the reconstruction of religious thought in islam 1930 and many letters in the english language he also wrote a book on economics that is now rare in these he revealed his thoughts regarding

prayer human spirit and muslim culture as well as other political social and religious problems iqbal was invited to cambridge to participate in a conference in 1931 where he expressed his views including those on the separation of church and state to students and other participants i would like to offer a few pieces of advice to the young men who are at present studying at cambridge  i advise you to guard against atheism and materialism the biggest blunder made by europe was the separation of church and state this deprived their culture of moral soul and diverted it to atheistic materialism i had twentyfive years ago seen through the drawbacks of this civilization and therefore had made some prophecies they had been delivered by my tongue although i did not quite understand them this happened in 1907  after six or seven years my prophecies came true word by word the european war of 1914 was an outcome of the mistakes mentioned above made by the european nations in the separation of the church and the state iqbal also wrote some poems in punjabi such as piyaara jedi and baba bakri wala which he penned in 1929 on the occasion of his son javeds birthday a collection of his punjabi poetry was put on display at the iqbal manzil in sialkot iqbal was deeply influenced by punjabi sufis once a comrade recited a poem by bulleh shah and he was so much touched and overwhelmedthat tears rolled down his cheeks iqbal has been referred to as the poet of the east by academics institutions and the media the vicechancellor of quaideazam university dr masoom yasinzai stated in a seminar addressing a distinguished gathering of educators and intellectuals that iqbal is not only a poet of the east but is a universal poet moreover iqbal is not restricted to any specific segment of the world community but he is for all humanity yet it should also be born in mind that while dedicating his eastern divan to goethe the cultural icon par excellence iqbals payamimashriq constituted both a reply as well as a corrective to the western divan of goethe for by stylizing himself as the representative of the east iqbal endeavored to talk on equal terms to goethe as the representative of west iqbals revolutionary works through his poetry affected the muslims of the subcontinent iqbal thought that muslims had long been suppressed by the colonial enlargement and growth of the west for this concept iqbal is recognised as the poet of the east so to conclude let me cite annemarie schimmel in gabriels wing who lauds iqbals unique way of weaving a grand tapestry of thought from eastern and western yarns p xv a creative activity which to cite my own volume revisioning iqbal endows muhammad iqbal with the stature of a universalist poet and thinker whose principal aim was to explore mitigating alternative discourses to construct a bridge between the east and the west the urdu world is very familiar with iqbal as the poet of the east iqbal is also called muffakirepakistan the thinker of pakistan and hakeemulummat the sage of the ummah the pakistan government officially named him pakistans national poet in iran iqbal is known as iqbāle lāhorī persian اقبال لاهوری iqbal of lahore iqbals asrareikhudi and balijibreel are particularly popular in iran at the same time many scholars in iran have recognised the importance of iqbals poetry in inspiring and sustaining the iranian revolution of 1979 during the early phases of the revolutionary movement it was common to see people gathering in a park or corner to listen to someone reciting iqbals persian poetry which is why people of all ages in iran today are familiar with at least some of his poetry notably zaburiajam ayatollah ali khamenei has stated we have a large number of nonpersianspeaking poets in the history of our literature but i cannot point out any of them whose poetry possesses the qualities of iqbals persian poetry iqbal was not acquainted with persian idiom as he spoke urdu at home and talked to his friends in urdu or english he did not know the rules of persian prose writing  in spite of not having tasted the persian way of life never living in the cradle of persian culture and never having any direct association with it he cast with great mastery the most delicate the most subtle and radically new philosophical themes into the mould of persian poetry some of which are unsurpassable yet by the early 1950s iqbal became known among the intelligentsia of iran iranian poet laureate muhammad taqi bahar universalised iqbal in iran he highly praised the work of iqbal in persian in 1952 iranian prime minister mohammad mossadeq a national hero because of his oil nationalisation policy broadcast a special radio message on iqbal day and praised his role in the struggle of the indian muslims against british imperialism at the end of the 1950s iranians published the complete persian works in the 1960s iqbals thesis on persian philosophy was translated from english to persian ali shariati a sorbonneeducated sociologist supported iqbal as his role model as iqbal had rumi an example of the admiration and appreciation of iran for iqbal is that he received the place of honour in the pantheon of the persian elegy writerscitation needed iqbal became even more popular in iran in the 1970s his verses appeared on banners and his poetry was recited at meetings of intellectuals iqbal inspired many intellectuals including ali shariati mehdi bazargan and abdulkarim soroush his book the reconstruction of religious thought in islam was translated by mohammad masud noruzi key iranian thinkers and leaders who were influenced by iqbals poetry during the rise of the iranian revolution include khamenei shariati and soroush although much of the revolutionary guard was familiar with iqbals poetry at the inauguration of the first iqbal summit in tehran 1986 khamenei stated that in its conviction that the quran and islam are to be made the basis of all revolutions and movements iran was exactly following the path that was shown to us by iqbal shariati who has been described as a core ideologue for the iranian revolution described iqbal as a figure who brought a message of rejuvenation awakening and power to the muslim world iqbal has an audience in the arab world and in egypt one of his poems has been sung by umm kulthum the most famous modern egyptian artist while among his modern admirers there are influential literary figures such as farouk shousha in saudi arabia among the important personalities who were

services to islam the ceremony being held in konya the resting place of rumi iqbals views on the western world have been applauded by westerners including united states supreme court associate justice william o douglas who said that iqbals beliefs had universal appeal soviet biographer n p anikoy wrote iqbal is great for his passionate condemnation of weak will and passiveness his angry protest against inequality discrimination and oppression in all forms ie economic social political national racial religious etc his preaching of optimism an active attitude towards life and mans high purpose in the world in a word he is great for his assertion of the noble ideals and principles of humanism democracy peace and friendship among peoples others including wilfred cantwell smith stated that with iqbals anticapitalist holdings he was antiintellect because capitalism fosters intellect freeland abbott objected to iqbals views of the west saying that they were based on the role of imperialism and that iqbal was not immersed enough in western culture to learn about the various benefits of the modern democracies economic practices and science critics of abbots viewpoint note that iqbal was raised and educated in the european way of life and spent enough time there to grasp the general concepts of western civilisation iqbal is widely commemorated in pakistan where he is

returned in 1986 and—influenced by thatcherite economics—transformed the ppps platform from a socialist to a liberal one before leading it to victory in the 1988 election as prime minister her attempts at reform were stifled by conservative and islamist forces including president ghulam ishaq khan and the powerful military her administration was accused of corruption and nepotism and dismissed by khan in 1990 intelligence services rigged that years election to ensure a victory for the conservative islamic democratic alliance iji at which point bhutto became leader of the

widely suspected she was buried at her family mausoleum in garhi khuda baksh bhutto was a controversial figure who remains divisive she was often criticised as being politically inexperienced was accused of being corrupt and faced much opposition from pakistans islamist lobby for her secularist and modernising agenda in the early years of her career she was nevertheless domestically popular and also attracted support from western nations for whom she was a champion of democracy posthumously she came to be regarded as an icon for womens rights due to her political success in a maledominated society bhutto was born at pintos nursing home on 21 june 1953 in karachi sindh pakistan her father was the politician zulfikar ali bhutto and her mother was begum nusrat ispahani the latter was born in isfahan persia now iran to a wealthy persian merchant family of partial kurdish descent zulfikar was the son of shah nawaz bhutto a prominent politician who had served as prime

said the diaries of one of our ancestors giving the family details were washed away in a great flood in my greatgrandfathers time but as children we were told we were either descended from the rajputsor from the arabs who entered india through our home province of sindh in ad 712 some say that benazir bhutto is descended from the arains a muslim tribe of punjab who have a subclan called bhutta and they also claim to be descended from the arabs who entered india in ad 712 while others say that benazir is descended from the rajputs the couple had married in september 1951 and benazir was their first child she was given the name of an aunt who had died young the bhuttos three younger children were murtaza born 1954 sanam 1957 and shahnawaz 1958 when the elderly shah nawaz died in 1957 zulfikar inherited the familys land holdings making him extremely wealthy benazirs first language was english as a child she spoke urdu less frequently although she was fluent and barely spoke the local sindhi language her mother taught her some persian as a child benazir initially attended the lady jennings nursery school in karachi she was then sent to the convent of jesus and mary in karachi and from there to the jesus and mary convent a boarding school in murree murree is near the border with india and during the indopakistani war of 1965 bhutto and the other pupils underwent airraid practices taking her exams in december 1968 bhutto passed her olevels with high grades throughout her youth bhutto idolised her father and he in turn encouraged her educational development in contravention of traditional approaches to women then pervasive in pakistan relations between her parents were however strained during her childhood zulfikar embarked on extramarital affairs with other women and when nusrat objected he had her thrown out of their house she moved to iran but after zulfikar prevented her children from joining her there she returned to pakistan six months later settling in karachi throughout her life bhutto never publicly acknowledged this internal family discord when bhutto was five her father became the cabinet minister for energy and when she was nine he became the countrys foreign minister from an early age she was exposed to foreign diplomats and figures who were visiting her father among them zhou enlai henry kissinger and hubert humphrey when she was thirteen he resigned from the government and a year later established his own political party the pakistan peoples party ppp the ppp used the motto islam is our faith democracy is our policy socialism is our economy all power to the people it employed a populist strategy to attract votes promising roti kapra aur makan bread clothes and housing for every pakistani and insisting that the disputed territory of kashmir would be transferred from indian to pakistani control benazir immediately joined amid riots against the government of president ayub khan in 1968 zulfikar was arrested and imprisoned for three months during which he wrote to benazir to encourage her studies from 1969 to 1973 bhutto studied for an undergraduate degree at radcliffe college harvard university she started when she was sixteen which was younger than normal but zulfikar had pulled strings to allow her premature admittance zulfikar asked his friend john kenneth galbraith an economics professor at harvard who had formerly been a us ambassador to india to be her local guardian through him bhutto met his son peter galbraith who became a lifelong friend murtaza joined bhutto at harvard a year later bhutto found it difficult adjusting to life in the united states a fellow student said she cried most of her first semester although bhutto later called her time at harvard four of the happiest years of my life she became a campus tour guide with the crimson key society and the social secretary of her dormitory eliot house  she involved herself in campaigns against american involvement in the vietnam war joining a moratorium day protest on boston common she encountered activists involved in second wave feminism although was sceptical of some of the views expressed within the movement at harvard bhutto majored in comparative government and graduated cum laude with a bachelor of arts in 1973 in 1971 while she was at harvard zulfikar invited her to join him in new york city where he was involved in a united nations security council meeting on that years indopakistani war in december 1971 zulfikar assumed the presidency of pakistan the first democratically elected leader after 13 years of military rule in 1972 benazir accompanied her father to the indiapakistan summit in simla as a replacement for her mother who was ill there she was introduced to the indian prime minister indira gandhi while in simla she attracted much attention from both local and national indian press the first time she received such notice she attributed this to the fact that—in her words—she symbolized a new generation i had never been an indian i had been born in independent pakistan i was free of the complexes and prejudices which had torn indians and pakistanis apart in the bloody trauma of partition in 1974 she was flown to lahore to accompany her father at the organisation of islamic cooperations summit here she met a number of the assembled senior muslim world leaders who included libyas muammar gaddafi egypts anwar sadat syrias hafez alassad saudi arabias faisal and jordans hussein in autumn 1973 bhutto relocated to the united kingdom and began studying for a second undergraduate degree in philosophy politics and economics at lady margaret hall university of oxford after three years she received a secondclass degree at her fathers insistence she remained in oxford to study for a oneyear postgraduate degree reading international law and diplomacy at this point she attended st catherines college oxford one of her fellow students at oxford stated that there she epitomized the classic spoilt rich girl from a third world country she nevertheless made friends who later described her as a humorous and intellectually curious individual in 1977 she was elected president of the oxford union debating society the first asian woman to hold that post after her threemonth term was up she was succeeded by her close friend victoria schofield bhutto was also active in the local conservative association and it is through this connection that she is widely believed to have introduced future british prime minister theresa may to her future husband philip may\\ndespite the ongoing tensions between pakistan and india she interacted socially with indian students and while at oxford also made proposals of marriage to two fellow pakistani students but was rebuffed on both occasions bhutto biographer brooke allen thought that her time at oxford was almost certainly the happiest most carefree time of her life at oxford she led a campaign calling for the university to give her father an honorary degree she gained the support of her fathers old tutor the historian hugh trevor roper bhuttos campaign was opposed by counterprotests who believed that her fathers supposed involvement in the persecution of sheikh mujibur rahman and atrocities during the bangladesh liberation war made him unsuitable ultimately the university declined to award the honorary degree in later years bhutto acknowledged that at this time she had been ignorant of the pakistani armys complicity in the atrocities in bangladesh although always maintained that her father was blameless on the issue after her oxford education she returned to pakistan in june 1977 where she was scheduled to work at the prime ministers office and the interprovincial council of common interests during the rest of the summer intent on a career in the pakistani foreign service she was scheduled to take the services entrance exams later in the year other women on the subcontinent had picked up the political banners of their husbands brothers and fathers before me the legacies of political families passing down through the women had become a south asian tradition indira gandhi in india sirimavo bandaranaike in sri lanka fatima jinnah and my own mother in pakistan i just never thought it would happen to me — bhutto on the impact of her father in july 1977 zulfikar bhutto—who had just been reelected in a general election—was overthrown in a military coup operation fair play led by muhammad ziaulhaq the chief of army staff both zulfikar and benazir believed that zias coup had been assisted by the us central intelligence agency cia zulfikar claimed that in a 1975 meeting us diplomat henry kissinger had told him that the us would make a horrible example of him if he did not terminate pakistans efforts to build a nuclear bomb now in control of the country zia suspended the constitution and initiated a regime that combined military rule with social programs designed to further the islamisation of pakistani society according to islamic fundamentalist principles socialists intellectuals and journalists were arrested zulfikar too was arrested initially for less than a month after a crowd of over one million people greeted zulfikars release in karachi and demonstrations were held in support of the ousted president zia decided to eliminate him permanently in september zulfikar was rearrested and charged with the 1974 murder of muhammad ahmed khan kasuri the father of ahmed raza kasuri a vocal critic of zulfikars government after the coup bhuttos brothers were sent abroad to canvass international support for their father bhutto and her mother remained in pakistan although they were repeatedly detained for short periods when she was able bhutto visited her father in prison she and her mother put out a book about their father and encouraged ppp supporters to demonstrate in support of him she also assisted in the preparation of his defence case which was put before first the lahore high court which sentenced him to death and then the supreme court which upheld that decision former us attorney general ramsey clark attended the trial relating that it was a kangaroo court and that zulfikar did not receive a fair trial just before his execution zulfikar urged his wife and daughter to leave pakistan but they refused he was executed by hanging in april 1979 benazir and nusrat were then imprisoned for six months before being released and placed under house arrest for a further six months the two women were only fully released in april 1980 after the coup zulfikar had appointed his wife cochair of the ppp while in october 1977 benazir was appointed to the ppps central committee after zulfikars death benazir replaced his role in the party becoming its coleader in february 1981 she formally established the movement for the restoration of democracy mrd a group that brought together the ppp with other political parties in the country the pakistan muslim league pakistan democratic party mazdoor kisan party national awami party quomi mahazeazadi jamiatiulemaiislam and the tahrikiistiqlal the mrd called for a fourpoint program an end to martial law the restoration of the 1973 constitution parliamentary elections and the transfer of political power from the military to the elected representativescitation needed there was nevertheless much mutual suspicion among the parties in the mrd with bhutto having reluctantly allowed groups that firmly opposed her fathers government to join from abroad her brothers murtaza and shahnawaz turned to paramilitary action founding the al zulfikar group which trained its members to carry out acts of assassination and sabotage to oust zias military government after al zulfikar orchestrated the 1981 pakistan international airlines hijacking the government used this as the pretext for rearresting bhutto and her mother in march bhutto disapproved of the hijacking believing that it strengthened zias hand that she was punished for it may have exacerbated tensions with her brothers in july 1981 nusrat was released so that she could seek medical treatment for cancer abroad but bhutto was not she was kept for a time in karachi before being moved to sukkur prison and then back again to karachi during much of this period she was held in solitary confinement and experienced a range of health problems including hair loss gynaecological issues and anorexia in december she was moved into house arrest where she would remain for two years in the united states—a key ally of zias regime—peter galbraith helped rally support for bhutto including from the politicians claiborne pell and james buckley when zia visited washington dc in december 1982 they raised the issue of bhuttos imprisonment with him as international pressure mounted the pakistani government agreed to release her placing her on a flight to geneva in january 1984 from geneva bhutto proceeded to the united kingdom undergoing surgery on her mastoid before renting a flat in londons barbican estate there she socialised with friends going shopping hosting dinner parties and visiting the cinema one friend said that after her time in prison she remained in a mildly traumatized state jumping at sudden noise and worrying about who might be spying on her in march bhutto visited new york city and washington dc where she met with media figures and middleranking government officials but was kept at bay by the administration of president ronald reagan over the coming few years bhutto made several additional visits to the united states spoke to the european parliament in strasbourg visited the soviet union and undertook the umrah pilgrimage to mecca while in exile benazir became a rallying point for the ppp her flat became the unofficial headquarters of its members in exile these volunteers devoted themselves to raising international awareness of the political prisoners being held by zias regime although she was the partys acting chairperson many of its elder members were unhappy with this situation believing her insufficiently committed to socialism and fearing that the party would become nothing more than a bhutto family fiefdom murtaza believed that it was he and not benazir who was their fathers designated political heir as evidence he cited that he had been asked to manage his fathers larkana constituency in the 1977 general election bhutto biographer shyam bhatia thought that this was probably zulfikars intention as the latter would have recognised the significant impediments to a woman being elected leader in a conservative islamic society like pakistan benazir nevertheless maintained that her father had always wanted her to become a politician in july 1985 shahnawaz died under unexplained circumstances in the french city of cannes bhutto varyingly claimed that shahnawaz had been murdered by his wife raehana or had been killed on the orders of zia zias government allowed her to bring her brothers body to pakistan in august where it could be interred in the family cemetery at larkana shortly after the burial she was arrested and detained under house arrest in karachi until november at which point she was released and returned to europe in december 1985 martial law was lifted in pakistan and bhutto decided to return home she arrived at lahore airport in april 1986 where she was greeted by a large crowd an estimated two million people came to see her speak at iqbal park where she rallied against zias regime she then visited sindh punjab and balochistan speaking to further crowds and reestablished links with the mrd taking part in a prodemocracy rally on independence day on 14 august following the rally she was again arrested and detained for several weeks in landhi jail back in pakistan she agreed to an arranged marriage her mother selected asif ali zardari as a suitable husband he was from a landowning family and his father had obtained additional wealth through the construction and cinema industries the marriage ceremony took place in the clifton palace gardens at karachi in december 1987 the event was billed as the peoples wedding serving as a de facto political rally with a subsequent party in a lyari stadium being attended by 200000 people there some fired kalashnikovs into the air in celebration accidentally resulting in one death and multiple injuries bhutto would have been aware that being married gave her an image of respectability which would improve her chances of being elected she kept the bhutto family name rather than taking that of her new husband after the wedding she soon became pregnant and gave birth to her first son bilawal in may 1988 zia dissolved the assemblies and called a november election he had not wanted bhutto to win and his choice of date may have been deliberately chosen to coincide with the date when bhutto was projected to give birth thus hindering her ability to campaign he also sought to hinder her chances by declaring that the election would be held on a nonparty basis with candidates standing as individuals rather than as representatives of a political party bhutto and the ppp launched a legal challenge against this latter stipulation in august zia suddenly died when his aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff from bahawalpur airport a joint us–pakistani investigation was unable to ascertain the cause of the crash although sabotage was widely suspected with the soviets americans indians and israelis all presented as potential culprits bhutto privately attributed it to an act of god after zias death the supreme court announced that the election should take place on a party basis rather than the nonparty basis that zia had desired bhutto insisted that the ppp campaign separately from the mrd and dropped its socialist platform in favour of economic thatcherism and a commitment to the free market amid predictions that the ppp would win it received 18000 prospective candidates many offering the party money for their selection this influx of new members and candidates caused upset among many established members who felt that bhutto was deserting them in the buildup to the election there was a great sense of hope among liberal sectors of pakistani society however islamic fundamentalists said it was unislamic for the country to have a female leader their propaganda foregrounded what they presented as her unislamic behaviour including a photo of her dancing in a parisian nightclub zia loyalists and islamic fundamentalists united to form a new political party islami jamhoori ittehad iji which was funded by the interservices intelligence isi the isi also engaged in vote rigging in an attempt to secure an iji victory\\ndespite these difficulties bhutto led the ppp to victory in the election taking 93 of the 205 contested seats the iji took only 54 seats although the party secured control of punjab the countrys largest and most powerful province this meant that the ppp had the largest number of seats although not a clear majority both the ppp and iji courted independent mps hoping to woo them to their side and unsuccessful attempts were also made by the countrys rightwing forces to convince some of the elected ppp parliamentarians to switch allegiance to the iji the people of pakistan had rejected bigotry and prejudice in electing a woman prime minister it was an enormous honor and an equally enormous responsibility i had not asked for this role i had not asked for this mantle but the forces of destiny and the forces of history had thrust me forward and i felt privileged and awed — bhutto on becoming prime minister in her autobiography president ghulam ishaq khan was constitutionally obliged to invite bhutto to form the next government but was reticent to do so under growing pressure—including from the us a key ally—he reluctantly did so two weeks after the election to build her government bhutto formed a coalition with the muttahida qaumi movement mqm party which had 13 seats in parliament an action that upset the sindhi nationalist faction within her party she was sworn in as the prime minister of pakistan on 2 december 1988 bhutto became the first female prime minister in a muslimmajority country as well as pakistans second nationally elected prime minister at 35 years old she was the youngest elected leader in the islamic world the worlds youngest prime minister and the youngest female prime minister ever elected  after her election party workers were encouraged to refer to her as mohtarma respected lady there was hope among many observers that her premiership would mark a new era of multiparty democracy growing gender equality and better relations with india she personally stated that her electoral victory was the tipping point in the debate raging in the muslim world on the role of women in islam in 1988 bhutto published her autobiography subtitled daughter of the east in its british edition and daughter of destiny in the united states it was written with the assistance of an american ghost writer bhutto biographer brooke allen stating that it was preeminently a political performance written for a western audience with the intent of seducing western opinion and opinionmakers as well as whitewashing her fathers regime bhuttos autobiography contained several factual falsifications she wished to present herself as a groundbreaker when it came to gender issues and thus presented her mother nusrat as being far more conservative than she really was for instance falsely claiming that nusrat had urged her to wear the burqa when she had reached adolescence bhuttos first cabinet was the largest in pakistans history she appointed herself as the new treasury minister with her mother as a senior minister without portfolio and her fatherinlaw as chairman of the parliamentary public accounts committee quashing hopes that her administration would depart from the entrenched systems of cronyism in the country most of those in the administration had little political experience various members of the ppp old guard including mumtaz ali bhutto left the party in frustration at the procapitalist direction she had taken following her election there remained significant mistrust between bhutto and the rightwing military administration many senior military figures viewed her like her father as a threat to their dominant role in pakistans political arena the countrys three most powerful figures—the army chief aslam beg the isi chief hamid gul and president khan—all had contempt for her family this opposition was substantial and contributed to bhuttos inability to pass any major legislation during her first term in office however she had some successes with initiatives to encourage the development of civil society she ensured the release of a number of political prisoners detained under the zia government and lifted the ban on trade unions and student associations she removed many of the constraints imposed on nongovernmental organisations and introduced measures to lift the media censorship introduced by zias military administrations she entrusted shamsul hasan with dismantling the national press trust a conglomerate of over 15 newspapers but president khan delayed signing the documents and thus the trust would only be broken up during her second premiership among the problems facing pakistan when bhutto took the premiership was soaring employment and high unemployment the pakistani government was bankrupt with zia having borrowed at highinterest rates to pay government wages many of the policy promises she had made in her election campaign were not delivered because the pakistani state was unable to finance them she had claimed that a million new homes would be built each year and that universal free education and healthcare would be introduced none of which was economically feasible for her government to deliver the country also faced a growing problem with the illegal narcotics trade with pakistan being among the worlds largest heroin exporters and the drugs use rapidly increasing domestically bhutto pledged that she would take tough action on the powerful drug barons bhutto often argued with beg gul and khan over her desired policies and—according to allen—won some battles but ultimately lost the war against them bhutto succeeded in getting khans approval to change two of the countrys four provincial governors she appointed general tikka khan one of the few senior military officers who were loyal to her as the governor of punjab she sought to replace the chair of the joint chiefs of staff iftikhar ahmed sirohey but president khan refused to permit this bhutto disliked khans hostile attitude toward her but he had the backing of the military in the presidential election bhutto initially proposed malik qasim who had been involved in the mrd as the ppps nominee but the military refused to accept this bhutto relented and agreed that khan could be nominated as the ppps presidential candidate bhutto also wanted to replace mahbub ul haq as a finance minister but again the military opposed her compromising she accepted ul haqs continued role as finance minister but appointed wasim jafri as her financial advisor beg made it clear to bhutto that the military would not tolerate her interference in their control of the defence and foreign affairs at the time 60 of the countrys population lived in punjab province which was under the control of zias protégé nawaz sharif as provincial chief minister both sharif and bhutto attempted to remove the other from power with bhutto accusing sharif of having rigged the election to become chief minister sharif benefited from growing punjabi chauvinism toward the countrys sindhi minority as well as a perception that bhutto—a sindhi—was attacking the punjab although bhutto had long supported greater autonomy for pakistans provinces she opposed it in the case of the punjab sharifs punjabi authority refused to accept the federal officials whom bhutto posted there relations between bhutto and pakistans civil service also deteriorated causing paralysis of many state affairs bhutto spoke of it as zias bureaucracy and her perceived antipunjabi stance impacted many civil servants of whom 80 were punjabi in april 1989 opposition parties organised a parliamentary noconfidence vote in bhuttos leadership but it was defeated by 12 votes bhutto claimed that many national assembly voters had been bribed to vote against her with 10\\xa0million having been supplied for this by a saudi salafi cleric osama bin laden who sought to overthrow her government and replace it with an islamic theocracy her conservative critics continued to claim it was unislamic for a woman to govern and unsuccessfully tried to have pakistan suspended from the international organisation of islamic cooperation on this basis during her first premiership bhutto went on a number of foreign trips enhancing her image as the first female prime minister in the islamic world in these she sought to attract foreign investment and aid for pakistan she also made efforts to cultivate good relationships with the leaders of islamic countries who also had good relationships with her father including libyas gaddafi abu dhabis sheikh zayed and the saudi royal family in 1989 she attended the commonwealth heads of government meeting in kuala lumpur where pakistan was readmitted to the commonwealth of nations in january 1989 she made a second pilgrimage to mecca and in june visited the us to address both houses of congress and giving the commencement speech at harvard as premier bhutto was reluctant to challenge the isis support for the islamist mujahideen forces in afghanistan which were then engaged in a civil war against the countrys marxist–leninist government the us was funneling money to these mujahedeen through pakistan although preferred to deal directly with beg gul and ishaq khan rather than through bhutto in april 1989 gul led an invasion of afghanistan with the purpose of seizing jalalabad which was then to be formed into a capital from which the countrys antisoviet islamistdominated opposition forces could operate when the operation failed and the pakistanis were driven out by the afghan army gul blamed bhuttos administration for the failure claiming that someone in her entourage had leaked details of the mission to the afghan government gul was too powerful for bhutto to force him into retirement but in may 1989 she transferred him from the isi to another section of the military placing a more trusted military figure in his role bhutto initially attempted to improve relations with neighbouring india withdrawing zias offer of a nowar pact and announcing the 1972 simla agreement as the basis of future relations she invited indian prime minister rajiv gandhi and his wife sonia as her guests for a threeday visit in islamabad following the south asian association for regional cooperation summit rajiv returned on a bilateral visit six months later she pleased him by revoking zias offer of the nishanepakistan award to the former indian leader morarji desai the two countries agreed to reduce their military levels along the border and agreed not to attack their respective nuclear installations bhutto claimed that she terminated support for sikh separatists active in india something which zia had encouraged to destabilise indian control in their half of the punjab this warming of relations angered many domestic islamist and conservative forces they alleged that she and gandhi were having a sexual relationship said that she was secretly an indian agent and also placed renewed emphasis on the fact that bhuttos paternal grandmother had been born to a hindu family the people of kashmir do not fear death because they are muslims the kashmiris have the blood of the mujahids and ghazis the kashmiris have the blood of muhajadeens because kashmiris are the heirs of prophet mohammed hazrat ali and hazrat omarand the brave women of kashmir they know how to fight and also to live and when they live they do so with dignity from every village only one voice will emerge freedom from every school only one voice will emerge freedom every child will shout freedom freedom freedom — bhuttos speech rallying kashmiri militants to fight for independence from india 1990 after accusations of being too conciliatory towards india bhutto took a harder line against them particularly on the kashmir conflict amid growing kashmiri protests against indian rule in interviews bhutto expressed support for the kashmiri muslim community she called on the united nations to oversee the kashmir plebiscite originally promised in 1948 bhutto visited a training camp for proindependence kashmiris on the pakistani side of the border and pledged 5 million for their cause she followed this with further statements in support of the proindependence groups in one speech she incited kashmiri muslims to rise up against their administration later in a 1993 interview bhutto stated that supporting proxy wars in punjab and kashmir was the one right thing undertaken by zia presenting these in part as revenge for indias role in the humiliating loss of bangladesh in 1990 major general pervez musharraf proposed a military invasion of kargil as part of an attempt to annex kashmir bhutto refused to back the plan believing that the international condemnation would be severe\\nwith both armies mobilizing on either side of the border there were growing fears that tensions over kashmir could result in a nuclear war between pakistan and india the us sent special envoy robert gates to the region to dissuade the pakistanis from going to war he could not meet bhutto—who was in yemen as part of a tour of the gulf states—but met with president khan informing him that the us would not support pakistani military action he convinced pakistan to step back from hostilities and to disband the kashmiri training camps in its territory after bhutto became prime minister president khan and the military were reluctant to tell her about pakistans nuclear program and it remains unknown how much bhutto knew about the issue during her first term in office she later related that to find out more she contacted key scientists in the program such as a q khan herself bypassing the president and military hierarchy on her trip to the united states she told congress that we do not possess nor do we intend to make a nuclear device while in washington dc she met with cia director william webster who showed her a mockup of the pakistani nuclear weapon and stated his opinion that research the project it had reached a crescendo in the final years of zias government williams revelations came as a shock to bhutto who was unaware of how advanced  pakistans nuclear development had become the united states wanted to prevent pakistan from creating such a device and president george h w bush informed her that us military aid to the country would cease unless pakistan refrained from producing nuclear bomb cores the final step in creating the weapon between january and march 1989 she authorised cold tests of nuclear weaponry without fissionable material although this did not satisfy the military authorities in 1990 shortly before leaving office the american ambassador robert oakley informed her that information obtained by us satellites indicated that her commitment to not produce weaponsgrade uranium had been breached at the kahuta enrichment plant the isi organised operation midnight jackal through which they used bribery and intimidation to discourage national assembly members from voting with the ppp\\nby 1990 the revelation of midnight jackal lessened president khans influence in national politics government and the military in the 1980s ethnic violence had broken out in sindh province with most of those killed being mohajirs late in 1989 the mqm—whose party represented mohajir interests—left bhuttos coalition government the mqm then joined other voices in calling for a general strike to protest bhuttos government in may 1990 she ordered the army to restore peace in karachi and hyderabad within months of bhuttos election dissolution had set in among her liberal supporters her narrow majority in the national assembly had left her unable to reverse many of the islamist reforms that zia had introduced she did not repeal the hudood ordinances which remained in law until 2006 her opposition to legalised abortion frustrated many pakistani feminists throughout her first term bhutto was criticised for being indecisive and unable to maintain control there had been anger that her husband had been allowed to attend cabinet meetings despite not being a member of the government he was also accused of receiving kickbacks and gained the nickname mr ten percent the isi had extensively spied upon bhutto and her husband throughout her period in office president khan privately paid plaintiffs to file corruption suits against bhuttos husband while the investigations into his corruption were therefore politically motivated there also was significant evidence of his guilt in this regard in 1990 bhutto gave birth to her first daughter bakhtawar tales of corruption in publicsector industries began to surface which undermined the credibility of bhutto the unemployment and labour strikes began to take place which halted and jammed the economic wheel of the country and bhutto was unable to solve these issues due to the cold war with the president in august 1990 khan dismissed bhuttos government under the eighth amendment of the constitution he claimed that this was necessary owing to her governments corruption and inability to maintain law and order a caretaker government under the control of former ppp member ghulam mustafa jatoi was sworn in with khan declaring a state of national emergency khan called for new elections in the meantime bhutto and her husband were forbidden to leave pakistan although they purchased an apartment in queens gate in the south kensington area of london in october zardari was arrested on charges of extortion according to the allegations he had attached a remotecontrol bomb to the leg of a businessman and forced the latter to enter a bank and withdraw money he was convicted and remained in prison for three years in the 1990 general election the ppp only secured 45 of the 217 seats the iji under the leadership of nawaz sharif won a majority in the parliament and sharif became prime minister bhutto became the leader of the opposition from this position she attacked sharifs every policy highlighting his governments failings in dealing with pakistans problems of poverty unemployment and lack of healthcare although not also discussing her own administrations failures on those same issues to journalists she remained unrepentant about her period in office insisting that she had made no mistakes she subsequently also accused sharif of backing the salafi jihadist militant group alqaeda established by bin laden following the assassination of rajiv gandhi in may 1991 bhutto visited india to attend his funeral as dissatisfaction with sharifs government grew the ppp began to restore the support it had lost during bhuttos premiership encouraging public protests in november 1992 she organised a 10mile march from rawalpindi to islamabad in protest at the iji government sharif ordered her to be placed under house arrest to prevent her instigating any uprisings despite an economic recovery in late 1993 the iji government faced public unease about the direction of the country and industrialisation that revolved around and centered only in punjab province amid protest and civil disorder in sindh province following the imposition of operation cleanup the ida government lost control of the province the peoples party attacked the ida governments record on unemployment and industrial racism sharif had attempted to reduce the presidents powers relations between sharif and president khan also soured and the prime minister came under pressure to resign from the armed forces with growing tensions between him and president khan in april 1993 the latter used the eighth amendment to dismiss sharif as prime minister citing corruption and misadministration an agreement was reached whereby both sharif and khan would step down the military formed an interim government and called a general election for october 1993\\ntheir policies were very similar but a clash of personalities occurred with both parties making many promises but not explaining how they were going to pay for them bhutto promised price supports for agriculture pledged a partnership between government and business and campaigned strongly for the female vote in february 1993 bhutto gave birth to her daughter asifa that year she also declared herself chair of the ppp for life this move reflected the lack of internal democracy within the party which was increasingly referred to as the bhutto family party bfp during her campaign for the 1993 general election the salafi jihadist ramzi yousef unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate her twice yousef went on to play a role in the 1993 world trade center bombing in the us in the october 1993 general election the ppp won the most seats although it fell short of an outright majority with 86 seats sharifs new party the pakistan muslim league nawaz came second with 73 seats the ppp performed extremely well in bhuttos native province sindh and rural punjab while the pmln was strongest in industrial punjab and the largest cities such as karachi lahore and rawalpindi bhutto was again prime minister but this time had a weaker parliamentary mandate than she had had in 1988 she was officially sworn in on 19 october 1993 realising the threat to her premiership posed by an unsympathetic president bhutto ensured that a ppp member farooq leghari was nominated and duly elected to the presidency in november zardari was freed from prison after bhutto returned to office in 1993 during her second term bhutto appointed both her husband and mother to her cabinet the former was appointed investment minister chief of the intelligence bureau directorgeneral of the federal investigation agency and chair of the new environment protection council she gave him a monopoly on the countrys gold imports a post that earned him 10\\xa0million which he deposited in an indian bank allen suggested that measures like these reflected how bhutto had given up on all her previous ideals and simply caved into the culture of corruption—indeed excelled in it as she had excelled in so many other areas john burns a journalist from the new york times investigated the business transactions of bhutto and his wife exposing the scale of their corruption by 1996 their takings through these various deals were estimated at 15\\xa0billion a subsequent inquiry by pakistans accountability bureau found that in that year bhutto her husband and her mother only declared assets totaling 12\\xa0million leaving out the extensive foreign accounts and properties that they possessed despite their significant earnings the couple did not pay the amount of tax owed between 1993 and 1994 bhutto paid no income tax at all in 1996 transparency international ranked pakistan as the worlds second most corrupt country bhutto ordered the construction of a new residence in islamabad it covered 110 acres of ground and cost 50\\xa0million to construct in 1993 bhutto declared that her family burial ground would be converted into an official mausoleum and would undergo significant expansion she dropped the first architect she employed to do the job after deciding that she wanted a more islamic design she replaced him with waqar akbar rizvi instructing him to visit the tombs of mustafa kemal atatürk and ruhollah khomeini for inspiration in 1995 zardari purchased a fifteenbedroom country house at rockwood in surrey southern england to hide evidence of ownership he obtained the property through companies based in the isle of man she spent much of her second term abroad making 24 foreign trips during its first twelve months the ppp government made dramatic reforms in womens rights i appointed several women to my cabinet and established a ministry of womens development we created womens studies programs in universities we established a womens development bank to give credit only to enterprising women and we legalized and encouraged womens participation in international sports which had been banned in the years of the zia military dictatorship it was a solid start in a society where islam had been exploited to repress the position of women in society for a bitter generation — bhutto on the womens rights advances of her government seeking to advance womens rights in her second term bhutto signed pakistan to the international convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women she was also a founding member of the council of women world leaders a group established in 1996 bhutto oversaw the creation of a womens division in the government headed by a senior female civil servant as well as a womens bank she opened a series of allfemale police stations staffed with female officers to make women feel safer in coming forward to report crimes she established family courts with female judges to deal with child custody and family issues and in 1994–95 the first women judges were appointed to the supreme courts of peshawar and sindh the fundamentalist islamic laws introduced to restrict womens rights under zia nevertheless remained in place her failure to remove the hudood ordinances brought criticism from liberal circles and damaged her relations with womens and human rights groups bhutto stated that once back in the office she asked for reasons why the kahuta enrichment plant had broken her command by producing weaponsgrade uranium and implemented a new system of security at the plant to provide greater oversight of the facilitys scientists both the military and isi however supported the development of material that could produce viable nuclear weaponry india had developed the agni missile a system which would allow the country to strike all of pakistans major cities and as a counter many in the pakistani administration believed that they needed an equivalent launch pad system for their nuclear warheads they decided to make a deal with the north korean government exchanging information about enrichment for missile technology bhutto later claimed that on her 1993 visit to north korea she secretly carried a computer cd containing nuclear data although she subsequently retracted this claim bhutto also made a state visit to the us in 1995 where she convinced congress to repeal sanctions that they had imposed on pakistan over its nuclear weapons programme in 1990 in september 1996 the taliban secured power in afghanistan bhuttos government was one of only three countries to recognize it as the legitimate afghan government a move that further distanced it from its western allies the talibans rise coincided with a broader growth in opposition to bhutto from salafi islamist groups increasingly there were salafist protests against bhutto in countries other than pakistan during a trip to london bhutto faced islamist protests outside the dorchester hotel where she was staying speaking to uk prime minister john major she highlighted this protest as evidence for the growth of salafi ideology in britain commenting that it would generate problems for western countries in future bhutto was prime minister at a time of great racial tension in pakistan ethnic violence had broken out in sindh as muhajir—mobilised by the mqm—rioted in protest at what they saw as their poor treatment abductions bombings and murders became increasingly common in karachi to deal with the unrest bhutto permitted her interior minister naseerullah babar to launch operation blue fox a violent crackdown on the mqm by the time that the operation was officially completed the government announced that 3000 had been killed in karachi although the number may have been far larger an amnesty international report commented that while bhutto had declared that her government would end human rights abuses the use of torture rape and extrajudicial killings remained common in pakistani prisons sharif had been a proponent of laissez faire economics and his government had promoted privatisation during her second term bhutto also became increasingly open about her support for such an economic policy pursuing broadly similar approaches to those of sharif her second term therefore witnessed a liberal approach to economics and the privatisation of industrial plants pakistan saw a record 20 billion of foreign investment during this term largely in the power industry the country also entered the list of the worlds top ten developing capital markets\\nthere were far fewer public hopes regarding the second bhutto premiership than there had been for the first the countrys financial situation left no funds for her to pursue the desired social programs 70 of national revenues went on paying off the national debt while much of the other 30 went on the military which would not tolerate cuts to its budget the 1990s had seen severe economic problems for pakistan the countrys economic growth had declined to between 3 and 4 poverty rose to 33 and the percentage of households living in absolute poverty doubled with rapidly growing inflation and higher taxes there was growing discontent over pakistans economic situation the announcement of the 1995 budget was met with strikes and demonstrations as many ppp members became increasingly dissatisfied with bhutto during the 1990s they referred to her brother mir murtaza still in exile as zulfikars true heir from syria murtaza campaigned as an independent candidate for larkana in the sindh legislative assembly election of 1993 bhutto did not want him to join the ppp fearing him as a potential challenger to her leadership of the party however his mother nusrat campaigned for him helping him win the election having won he flew back to pakistan in november to take up his new position around ninety criminal charges had been brought against him under zias regime so on arrival murtaza was arrested and held for eight months in solitary confinement suvorova suggested that bhutto had allowed this as a concession to those including president leghari and the sindhi chief minister syed abdullah ali shah who insisted that murtaza face criminal proceedings for his militant activities murtaza maintained that it was he rather than his sister who was the standardbearer for their fathers championing of the downtrodden he espoused a socialist platform different from his sisters and called for internal elections within the ppp which could have resulted in the removal of bhutto animosity grew between the two siblings in june 1994 murtaza was released on bail and at his subsequent trial he was acquitted of all charges in 1995 he established his own party the ppp shaheed bhutto the partys name implied that he was closer to the bhuttos familys shaheed than his sister whom he symbolically distanced from the family by referring to her as begum zardari murtaza focused much of his criticism on bhuttos husband zardari whom he blamed of being responsible for government corruption he hung a picture of zardari up in the guest toilet of his house as an act of disrespect to his brotherinlaw a rumour spread that in one incident murtaza invited zardari to his house only to have him pinned down by bodyguards and half his mustache forcibly shaved off nusrat continued to support murtaza damaging her relationship with bhutto mother and daughter increasingly criticised one another bhutto was so angry with her mothers actions that she ousted her as cochair of the ppp this angered nusrat who told the new york times shes talked a lot about democracy but shes become a little dictator on 20 september 1996 murtaza was ambushed by police near karachi they opened fire killing him and seven others all witnesses were taken into police custody where two of them died it was widely believed in pakistan that the killing had been ordered by a senior government figure murtazas supporters thought that bhutto and her husband were responsible when bhutto tried to attend her brothers funeral in larkana local murtaza supporters pelted her car with rocks at the funeral nusrat—who had the early stages of alzheimers disease—also blamed bhutto for her brothers death bhutto initially blamed the killing on a conspiracy against her family she suggested that president leghari had been involved in an act designed to destabilise her government she brought in scotland yard to investigate partly to quell rumors that she had ordered the killing although the case remained unsolved after murtazas death bhutto reestablished a relationship with her mother her approval poll rose by 38 after she appeared and said in a private television interview after the elections we are unhappy with the manner in which tampered electoral lists were provided in a majority of constituencies our voters were turned away the conservatives attracted voters from religious society mma whose support had collapsed in confidential official documents benazir bhutto had objected to the number of urdu speaking class in 1993 elections in the context that she had no urduspeaking sentiment in her circle and discrimination was continued even in her government her stance on these issues was perceived as part of rising public disclosure which altaf hussain called racism due to benazir bhuttos stubbornness and authoritative actions her political rivals gave her the nickname iron lady of pakistan no response was issued by bhutto but she soon associated with the term benazir bhutto expanded the authoritative rights of police combatant force and the provisional governments that tackled the local opposition aggressively bhutto through her internal security minister naseerullah babar intensified the internal security operations and steps gradually putting down the oppositions political rallies while she did not completely abandon the reconciliation policy in her own worlds benazir bhutto announced there was no basis for strikes  in view of the ongoing political process bhutto was an economist by profession therefore during her terms as prime minister she herself took charge of the ministry of finance bhutto sought to improve the countrys declining economy she disagreed with her fathers nationalisation and socialist economics soon after the collapse of the soviet union benazir attempted to privatise major industries that had been nationalised in the 1970s bhutto promised to end the nationalisation programme and to carry out the industrialisation programme by means other than state intervention however bhutto did not carry out the denationalisation program or liberalisation of the economy during her first government no nationalised units were privatised and few economic regulations were reviewed pakistan suffered a currency crisis when the government failed to arrest the 30 fall in the value of the pakistani rupee from ₨ 21 to ₨30 per us dollar soon economic progress became her top priority but her investment and industrialisation programs faced major setbacks due to conceptions formed by investors based upon her peoples party nationalisation program in the 1970s by the 1990s khan and bhuttos government had also ultimately lost the currency war with the indian rupee which beat the value of pakistan rupee for the first time in the 1970s bhuttos denationalisation program also suffered from many political setbacks as many of her government members were either directly or indirectly involved with the government corruption in major governmentowned industries and her appointed government members allegedly sabotaged her efforts to privatise the industries overall the living standard for people in pakistan declined as inflation and unemployment grew at an exponential rate particularly as un sanctions began to take effect during her first and second term the difference between rich and poor visibly increased and the middle class in particular were the ones who bore the brunt of the economic inequality according to a calculation completed by the federal bureau of statistics the standard of living for the rich improved while the standard of living for the poor declined benazir attributed this economic inequality to be a result of ongoing and continuous illegal bangladeshi immigration bhutto ordered a crackdown on and deportation of illegal bangladeshi immigrants her action strained and created tensions in bangladesh–pakistan relations as bangladesh prime minister khaleda zia refused to accept the deportees and reportedly sent two planeloads back to pakistan religious parties also criticised bhutto and dubbed the crackdown as antiislamic this operation backfired and had devastating effects on pakistans economy president khan saw this as a major economic failure despite khans permission granted to bhutto for the approval of her economic policies khan blamed bhutto for this extensive economic slowdown and her policy that failed to stop the illegal immigration khan attributed bhuttos government members corruption in governmentowned industries as the major sinkhole in pakistans economy that failed to compete with neighboring indias economy during her second term bhutto continued to follow former prime minister nawaz sharifs privatisation policies which she called a disciplined macroeconomics policy after the 1993 general elections the privatisation programme of stateowned banks and utilities accelerated more than ₨ 42\\xa0billion was raised from the sale of nationalised corporations and industries and another us20\\xa0billion from the foreign investment made the united states after 1993 the countrys national economy again entered in the second period of the stagflation and more roughly began bite the countrys financial resources and the financial capital bhuttos second government found it extremely difficult to counter the second era of stagflation with pressler amendment and the us financial and military embargo tightened its position after a year of study bhutto implemented and enforced the eighth plan to overcome the stagflation by creating a dependable and effective mechanism for accelerating economic and social progress but according to american ambassador to pakistan william milams bibliography bangladesh and pakistan flirting with failure in south asia the eighth plan which reflected the planned economy of the soviet union was doomed to meet with failure from the very beginning of 1994 as the policies were weak and incoherent on many occasions bhutto resisted to privatise globally competitive and billiondollarworth stateowned enterprises such as pakistan railways and pakistan steel mills instead the grip of nationalisation in those stateowned enterprises was tightened in order to secure the capital investment of these industries the process of privatisation of the nationalised industries was associated with the marked performance and improvement especially the terms of labour productivity a number of privatisation of industries such as gas water supply and sanitation and electricity general were natural monopolies for which the privatisation involved little competition furthermore benazir denied that privatisation of the pakistan railways would take place despite the calls made in pakistan and was said to have told planning commission chief naveed qamar railways privatisation will be the black hole of this government please never mention the railways to me againcitation needed bhutto always resisted privatisation of united bank limited pakistan ubl but its management sent the recommendation for the privatisation which dismayed the labour union the united group of employees management asked bhutto for the issue of the regulation sheet which she denied the holding of ubl in government control turned out to be a move that ended in disaster for bhuttos government majorgeneral pervez musharraf worked closely with bhutto and her government in formulating an israel strategy in 1993 bhutto ordered musharraf then directorgeneral of the pakistani armys directorategeneral for the military operation dgmo to join her state visit to the united states unusual and unconventional participation bhutto and musharraf chaired a secret meeting with israeli officials who traveled to the us especially for the meeting under bhuttos guidance musharraf intensified the isis liaison with israels mossad a final meeting took place in 1995 which musharraf also joined bhutto also strengthened relations with its most important partner communist china and repeatedly visited beijing for mutual trade and international political cooperation the two countries in 1995 benazir bhutto made another state visit to the united states and held talks with us president bill clinton bhutto urged him to revise the pressler amendment and launch a campaign against extremism she criticised us nonproliferation policy and demanded that the united states honor its contractual obligationclarification needed during her second term relations with indian prime minister p v narasimha rao further deteriorated like her father benazir bhutto used rhetoric to oppose india and campaign in the international community against the indian nuclear program on 1 may 1995 she used harsh language in her public warning to india that continuation of indian nuclear program would have terrible consequences india responded to this saying she was interfering in an internal matter of india and the indian army fired a rpg at the kahuta which further escalated events leading to fullfledged war when this news reached bhutto she responded by highalerting the air force strategic command it ordered heavily armed arrows griffins black panthers and the black spiders to begin air sorties and to patrol the indopakistan border on dayandnight regular missions all of these squadrons are part of the strategic command on 30 may india testfired a prithvi1 missile near the pakistan border which bhutto condemned she responded by deploying shaheeni missiles however they were not armed benazir bhutto permitted the paf to deploy the crotale missile defence and the anzamkiii near the indian border which escalated the conflict but effectively kept the indian army and the indian air force from launching any surprise attack in 1995 the isi reported to bhutto that narasimha rao had authorised nuclear tests and that they could be conducted at any minute benazir put the countrys nuclear arsenal programme on highalert made emergency preparations and ordered the pakistani armed forces to remain on highalert however the united states intervened indian operations for conducting the nuclear tests were called off and the japanese government attempted to mediate in 1996 benazir bhutto met with japanese officials and warned india about conducting nuclear tests she revealed for the first time that pakistan had achieved parity with india in its capacity to produce nuclear weapons and their delivery capability she told the indian press that pakistan cannot afford to negate the parity we maintain with india these statements represented a departure from pakistans previous policy of nuclear ambivalence bhutto issued a statement on the tests and told the international press that she condemned the indian nuclear tests if india conducts a nuclear test it would force her pakistan to  follow suit she said bhutto also ratcheted up her policy on indian kashmir rallying against india at an interparliamentary union meeting at the united nations bhutto who was accompanied by her speaker yousaf raza gillani upset and angered the indian delegation headed by prime minister atal bihari vajpayee with vehement criticism of india vajpayee responded saying it is pakistan which is flouting the united nations resolution by not withdrawing its forces from kashmir\\xa0 you people create problems every time you know the kashmiri people themselves acceded to india first the maharajah then the kashmiri parliament both decided to go with india during her second term benazir bhuttos relations with the pakistan armed forces took a different and probhutto approach when she carefully appointed general abdul waheed kakar as the chief of army staff general abdul waheed was an uptight strict and a professional officer with a view of westernised democracy benazir also appointed admiral saeed mohammad khan as chief of naval staff general abbas khattak as chief of air staff whilst air chief marshal farooq feroze khan was appointed chairman joint chiefs who was the first and to date only pakistani air officer to have reached to such 4 stars assignment benazir bhutto enjoyed strong relations with the pakistan armed forces and president who was handpicked by her did not question her authority she handpicked officers and promoted them based on their prodemocracy views while the president gave constitutional authorisation for their promotion the senior military leadership including jehangir karamat musharraf kayani ali kuli khan farooq feroze khan abbas khattak and fasih bokhari had strong westerndemocratic views and were generally close to bhutto as they had resisted nawaz sharifs conservatism unlike nawaz sharifs second democratic term benazir worked with the military on many issues where the military disagreement solving many problems relating directly to civilmilitary relations her tough and hardline policies on afghanistan kashmir and india which the military had backed benazir bhutto staunchly after the assassination was attempted benazir bhuttos civilian security team headed under rehman malik was disbanded by the pakistan army whose xcorps 111th psychological brigade— an army brigade tasked with countering the psychological warfare— took control of the security of benazir bhutto that directly reported to chief of army staff and the prime minister benazir bhutto ordered general abdul waheed kakar and the lieutenantgeneral javed ashraf qazi directorgeneral of isi to start a sting and manhunt operation to hunt down the ringmaster ramzi yousef after few arrests and intensive manhunt search the isi finally captured ramzi before he could flee the country in a matter of weeks ramzi was secretly extradited to the united states while the isi managed to kill or apprehend all the culprits behind the plot in 1995 she personally appointed general naseem rana as the directorgeneral of the isi who later commanded the pakistan armys assets in which came to known as pakistans secret war in afghanistan during this course general rana directly reported to the prime minister and led the intelligence operations after which were approved by benazir bhutto in 1995 benazir also appointed admiral mansurul haq as the chief of naval staff as the admiral had personal contacts with the benazirs family however it was the admirals largescale corruption sponsored by her husband asif zardari that shrunk the credibility of benazir bhutto by the end of 1996 that led to the end of her government after all relations between bhutto and leghari had declined after she suggested he had been involved in her brothers murder leghari sought the backing of the army chief karamat to move against her premiership leghari warned bhutto that he would dismiss her government unless she introduced measures to curtail corruption and deal with the economic crisis in response she gave up her role as minister of finances and dismissed most of her economic advisers in october 1996 she nevertheless maintained that the countrys economic problems were the fault of sharifs previous administration citing the eighth amendment of the constitution on 5 november leghari dismissed bhuttos government on the grounds of corruption and incompetence he added the suspicion that bhutto had been involved in her brothers death troops surrounded bhuttos residence while zardari tried to leave the country for dubai but was arrested and imprisoned charged with money laundering and involvement in murtazas murder he remained in prison until 2004 leghari installed a civilian caretaker government led by malik meraj khalid while announcing forthcoming elections for february 1997 \\nbhutto challenged the constitutionality of legharis decision taking the issue to the supreme court but they ruled in agreement with the president in january in a 6–1 ruling the supreme courts decision also resulted in the removal of all probhutto elements from the military in the ensuing election which took place in february 1997 sharif was reelected the ppp had secured only 18 seats in the national assembly some pakistani feminist groups had refused to back bhuttos reelection because despite her repeated promises she had not removed the hudud ordinances that zias administration had introduced newly reelected sharif moved quickly to curtail the powers of the presidency and judiciary he removed the constitutions eighth amendment which had been used by successive presidents to oust both bhutto and himself from office sharif also launched judicial proceedings against bhutto\\nin 1998 india tested its first nuclear weapon bhutto responded with an editorial for the los angeles times in which she argued that the international community should go further than imposing economic sanctions on india but should launch a preemptive bomb strike on indias nuclear facilities she called on sharif to retaliate with a series of pakistani military tests after sharifs government did so bhutto called for pakistan to sign the comprehensive nucleartestban treaty and arrive at a bilateral agreement on nuclear proliferation with india tensions between india and pakistan resulted in the kargil war of 1999 the conflict humiliated pakistan both militarily and politically and left the country with a very poor international standing bhutto observed the conflict from abroad describing it as pakistans biggest blunder in april 1999 the ehtesab bench of the lahore high court convicted bhutto in absentia giving her a five years prison sentence an 86\\xa0million fine and disqualifying her from public office the pakistani authorities unsuccessfully tried to secure her arrest and extradition through interpol bhutto claimed that this was politically motivated she was in london at the time of the judgment and rather than returning to pakistan she relocated to dubai she decided on dubai because zayed bin sultan al nahyan the president of the united arab emirates had been a longstanding friend of her family she brought her mother and three children to live there with her settling into a villa in the emirates hills given to her by the emirati government she claimed that were she to return to pakistan then she would be imprisoned and then murdered she remained in dubai for eight years for five of which her husband remained imprisoned in pakistan she remained head of the ppp\\nand spent much of her time in exile fighting the corruption charges that were being brought against her and her husband two years later a retrial was ordered after it was ascertained that undue political bias was exerted on the judges bhutto also campaigned for zardaris release from prison some of her close political advisers suggested that she abandon him for the sake of her political career but she refused while in dubai she also focused on raising her children and caring for her mother whose alzheimers disease had progressed to a severe stage in october 1999 the chair of the joint chiefs of staff pervez musharraf launched a military coup which ousted sharif from power bhutto called the coup disturbing and distressing but noted that it had got rid of sharif an unpopular despot who was hounding the press the judiciary the opposition the foreign investors she called on western countries to push for a return to electoral democracy in pakistan musharraf stated that both sharif and bhutto had misgoverned the country and had failed to allow internal democracy within their own parties pointing to bhuttos appointment as chair for life of the ppp something he compared to the old african dictators in april 2000 sharif was convicted of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment at the request of the saudi monarch sharif was released from prison after a year and exiled to saudi arabia he was also disqualified from holding public office in 2002 musharraf amended the constitution to ban anyone serving more than two terms as prime minister thus disqualifying both bhutto and sharif whom he called useless politicians musharraf also consolidated power around himself in june 2001 he appointed himself to the presidency holding this position alongside his positions as chief executive and chief of the army staff he talked about the need for a return to democracy and to respect human rights he was a secularist and repealed the hudood ordinances an achievement bhutto had been unable to make in an april 2002 referendum musharraf extended his presidential mandate for a further five years bhutto expressed concern that with mainstream politicians removed from pakistans political arena the vacuum would be filled by islamist extremists she was in dubai while the ppp contested the october 2002 general election it received the largest number of votes but only 63 seats in the national assembly musharraf agreed to release zardari in november 2004 as a symbol of good will following his release zardari travelled to new york for medical treatment bhutto flew to new york roughly every three weeks to visit him the couple did not officially acknowledge it but their relationship was essentially over figures in the ppp alleged that musharraf held a longstanding animosity towards bhutto and her family because under her father musharrafs father had been sacked from his position accused of involvement in a scam in june 1997 the pakistani government formally requested that the swiss government review bank accounts owned by bhutto and her husband in 1998 a swiss magistrate daniel devaud seized a safedeposit box containing a 190000 necklace that bhutto had purchased in londons bond street the previous year over the following six years he investigated how bhutto had obtained the money used to buy this item his investigations were followed by a bbc documentary team led by owen bennettjones devauds investigations revealed a range of corrupt deals that zardari had been involved with it was discovered that dassault a french aircraft manufacturer had agreed to pay zardari and another pakistani man 200\\xa0million to ensure he would facilitate a 4\\xa0billion sales of fighter jets it was also revealed that in both bhutto and zardari had taken approximately 15\\xa0million in exchange for awarding a customs contract to the swiss firms sgscotecna when she was prime minister devaud concluded that bhutto knew she was acting in a criminally reprehensible manner by abusing her role in order to obtain for herself and for her husband considerable sums in the interest of her family at the cost of the islamic republic of pakistan benazir bhutto was embroiled in a number of cases being pursued by nawaz sharifs government in 1997 she termed those cases as a part of sharifs plan to eliminate her from politics in an effort to challenge sharif governments ehtesab drive ms bhutto along with other ppp leaders visited the ehtesab commission islamabad where she handed over corruption references against then pm nawaz sharif and his brother shehbaz sharif to abdul jaleel director special enquiries at the ehtesab commission these references contained charges of corruptions against sharif family and saifurrehman who was a close aide of nawaz sharif ms bhutto gave full statements of facts of complaints in 1998 switzerland issued a request for the arrest of bhutto on suspicion of money laundering the geneva city court subsequently charged zardari in absentia with laundering money and taking bribes of 15 million from sgs and cotecna a swiss court ordered her to turn over 119\\xa0million to the pakistani state and to serve 180 days in prison 17 swiss bank accounts owned by the zardaribhutto family were frozen by the countrys government in 2004 a uk court ruled that rockwood estate in surrey—which zardari owned despite his repeated denials—should be sold and the proceeds given to the pakistani state who were the rightful owners zardari protested admitting that he owned the property and that he should receive the proceeds of its sale through a spokesman bhutto said that the charges against her represented a witch hunt and compared them to mccarthyism she expressed bemusement as to why many thought her spending was lavish i mean what is poor and what is rich if you mean am i rich by european standards do i have a billion dollars or even a hundred million dollars even half that no i do not but if you mean that im ordinary rich yes my father had three children studying at harvard as undergraduates at the same time but this wealth never meant anything to my brothers or me she maintained that the charges against her and her husband were purely political bhutto ignored the summons to travel to switzerland to serve her sentence she challenged the court ruling and secured a retrial which overturned the previous ruling however allen commented no one seriously suggested that the evidence had been fixed or that bhutto and zardari were not thieves on a grand scale bhutto was a client of mossack fonseca whose customer records were disclosed in the panama papers leak 7 september 2001 london law firm richard rooney and co told mfbvi mossack fonseca british virgin islands to create petroline international inc in the british virgin islands petroline international inc is owned by bhutto her nephew hassan ali jaffery bhutto and her aide and head of security rehman malik who later became a senator and interior minister in the government of yousaf raza gillani mossack fonseca had declined to do business with bhuttos first company similarly named petrofine fzc established in sharjah united arab emirates uae in 2000 the petrofine was politically sensitive they said and declined to accept mrs bhutto as a client a united nations committee chaired by former head of the us federal reserve paul volcker concluded in a 2005 investigation into abuses of the oilforfood program that petrofine fzc had paid us2\\xa0million to the iraqi government of saddam hussein to obtain us115–145\\xa0million in oil contracts in 2006 the pakistani national accountability bureau nab accused bhutto malik and ali jaffery of owning petrofine bhutto and the ppp denied this in april 2006 an nab court froze assets owned in pakistan and elsewhere by bhutto and zardari the 15\\xa0billion in assets were acquired through corrupt practices the nab said and noting that the 1997 swiss charges of criminal moneylaundering were still in litigation\\nat pakistans request interpol issued notices—but not arrest warrants—for bhutto and her husband on 27 january 2007 she was invited by the united states to speak to president george w bush and congressional and state department officials the us and uk had supported musharraf because of his role in assisting their war on terror—especially the war in afghanistan—but they gradually lost faith in his ability to rule successfully his domestic popularity was slipping a mid2007 poll gave him only a 26 approval rating in 2007 mass antimusharraf protests broke out in what was known as the lawyers movement pakistan was also experiencing growing levels of violence from islamist militants such as the siege of lal masjid official figures held that eight suicide bombings took place in 2006 and 44 in 2007 the us government increasingly saw bhutto as an important figure who could help to constrain pakistans domestic problems they nevertheless wanted a powersharing deal and did not want musharraf removed from power completely regarding him as a vital ally in their war on terror assisted by luis ayala the secretarygeneral of the socialist international in 2006 bhutto and sharif began a process of reconciliation  ayala believed that this was a prerequisite for ensuring pakistans transition back to democratic elections both bhutto and sharif had residences in london not far from one another facilitated by the lawyer aitzaz ahsan the pair developed a joint plan of action in may 2006 they both signed a charter of democracy a document calling for an end to military rule they established a committee consisting of four pakistani senators two from the ppp and two from the pakistan muslim league nawaz henceforth bhutto avoided openly criticizing sharif as she once had concerned about the instability of their ally the us government pushed musharraf to meet with bhutto and come to an arrangement that might strengthen his legitimacy this was also encouraged by the uk government in january 2007 musharraf held his first meeting with bhutto at a hotel in abu dhabi followed by further talks in june as a result of their discussions it was agreed that the pakistani authorities would drop all charges of corruption against both bhutto and her husband this was achieved through the introduction of the national reconciliation ordinance a measure which nullified all pending criminal proceedings against politicians the ordinance also lifted musharrafs ban on individuals serving more than two terms as prime minister\\nit was agreed that if musharraf stepped down from his military positions and was elected as a civilian president then bhutto would be willing to serve under him as prime minister many of musharrafs close allies had reservations about his concessions to bhutto the united states condoleezza rice and the uks jack straw worked together to ensure a transition back to electoral democracy in pakistan the uk and spain both dropped criminal investigations into bhuttos corruption although switzerland refused to do so in august 2007 the us ambassador to the united nations zalmay khalizad had several meetings with bhutto in new york city there bhutto also gave a public talk at the council of foreign relations bhutto and khalizad also traveled to a luncheon in aspen colorado to meet with prominent us political and business leaders in october 2007 musharraf was elected president by pakistans parliament in keeping with the agreement made by bhutto and musharraf the ppp representatives abstained rather than voting against musharrafs nomination the us publisher harpercollins paid bhutto half a million dollars to produce a book to be titled reconciliation cowritten with the us political scientist and journalist mark siegel it would be published in 2008 as reconciliation islam democracy and the west reconciliation was partly a response to the clash of civilisations theory that had been popularised by the american political scientist samuel p huntington during the 1990s she argued that huntingtons theory denied the universality of democratic ideals and created a selffulfilling prophecy of fear whereby it provoked the conflicts that it claimed to predict in reconciliation she proposed that western countries finance a new marshall plan to aid the poor in muslimmajority countries believing that this would improve islamic attitudes toward the west bhutto returned to pakistan in october 2007 arriving in karachi it was widely thought that she had a strong chance of becoming the countrys next prime minister in the 2008 national elections although her deal with musharraf and links with the us had dented her popularity and sharif—still in saudi arabia—was more popular in the opinion polls musharraf was annoyed at her arrival having requested that she return only after the election her husband and daughters remained in dubai while her son was still studying at oxford bhutto described the main problem facing her country as the clash between moderation and extremism and was pessimistic about her safety musharraf himself had survived several assassination attempts by islamist militants and warned bhutto that she too would be a target she requested that the us or uk take responsibility for her security but they refused and her security detail was instead organised by musharraf while her cavalcade was making its way through a crowd in karachi two bombs exploded killing 149 and injuring 402 bhutto herself was physically unharmed bhutto alleged that there were four suicide squads that had been dispatched to eliminate her and that there were key officials in the government involved in the plot she sent a list naming these officials to musharraf bhutto requested that musharraf bring in the british scotland yard or the united states federal bureau of investigation to investigate the crime but he refused relations between the pair were further strained when musharraf declared a state of emergency and suspended the constitution in november at which point bhutto was visiting dubai the ppp and pmln launched protests at musharrafs actions against the warnings of some of her advisors bhutto quickly returned to pakistan where she was briefly placed under house arrest she then publicly denounced musharraf fearing that any association with him would damage her credibility on 26 november sharif returned from exile that same day bhutto filed papers to contest two parliamentary seats in the larkana constituency as he had previously agreed with bhutto musharraf then retired as army chief and was sworn in as pakistans civilian president in early december bhutto met with sharif to publicise their demand that musharraf fulfil his promise to lift the state of emergency before januarys parliamentary elections threatening to boycott the vote if he failed to comply on 16 december musharraf did so\\nbhutto announced that the ppp would campaign on the five es employment education energy environment and equality the ppps manifesto called for greater civilian oversight of and restrictions on the military and intelligence agencies they also vowed to rid the intelligence services of elements driven by political or religious motives on the morning of 27 december 2007 bhutto met with afghan president hamid karzai in the afternoon she gave a speech at a ppp rally held in rawalpindis liaquat national bagh on leaving in a bulletproof vehicle she opened the cars escape hatch and stood up to wave to the surrounding crowds a man standing within two to three metres of the car fired three gunshots at her and detonated a suicide vest packed with ball bearings bhutto was fatally injured reports differ as to whether she was hit by bullets or by shrapnel from the explosion twentytwo others also died bhutto was rushed to rawalpindi general hospital but was clinically dead on arrival and attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful no autopsy was conducted and the body was swiftly transported to chaklala air base the following day she was buried next to her father in the bhutto family mausoleum garhi khuda bakhsh her family graveyard near larkana musharraf declared a threeday period of mourning while ppp supporters rioted in various parts of pakistan leading to at least 50 deaths authorities claimed that the assassin had been a teenage boy from south waziristan they claimed to have proof that the attack had been masterminded by baitullah mehsud leader of the pakistani taliban the united states central intelligence agency concurred that this was probable although mehsud denied the accusation mehsud nevertheless had a motive he believed that bhuttos proamerican and secularist agenda would undermine the pakistani talibans control of south waziristan and hinder the growth of sunni islamist radicalism alqaeda commander mustafa abu alyazid claimed responsibility for the assassination declaring that we terminated the most precious american asset which vowed to defeat the mujahideen the ppp accused the government of a coverup with several ppp figures claiming that bhutto had been killed by a sniper linked to the intelligence agencies within pakistan there was also public speculation that the attack might have been masterminded by india or the united states musharraf agreed to invite britains scotland yard to investigate the assassination although its eventual report proved inconclusive requests for the body to be exhumed for an autopsy were rejected by zardari in bhuttos political will she had designated her son bilawal who was then 19 as her political heir as chair of the ppp it also specified that her husband should serve as custodial chairman until bilawal completed his formal education zardari became cochair of the ppp the academic anna suvorova specified that bhuttos assassination created a real family cult one which was fuelled by various apocrypha rituals and relics in the wake of bhuttos death the election was postponed from january to february 2008 when it resulted in the formation of a coalition government bringing together the ppp and the pakistan muslim league nawaz the new coalition put forth ppp member yousuf raza gilani as prime minister musharraf facing likely impeachment resigned as president in august he fled to london although in february 2011 a rawalpindi court issued a subpoena for him on the grounds that he had not acted on known threats to bhutto and had provided insufficient security to protect her in september 2008 zardari was elected president of pakistan by the countrys electoral college he remained in that position until 2013 as president zardari called for a united nations investigation into his wifes assassination in 2009 the un secretary general ban kimoon established a threeperson team to lead the investigation comprising the chilean heraldo muñoz irish peter fitzgerald and indonesian marzuki darusman although it was not in the commissions remit to identify a culprit muñoz later expressed the view that the assassination was likely carried out by the pakistani taliban perhaps with the support of mehsud and that they may well have been assisted by rogue elements in the countrys intelligence agencies he also expressed the view that the original police investigation had been deliberately botched in february 2012 the pakistani official enquiry issued its final report placing responsibility for the attack with 27 different militant groups in may 2013 the states main prosecutor in the bhutto case zulfikar ali was himself assassinated in islamabad there was never a smoking gun in the bhutto investigation many in pakistan had reasons for wanting bhutto dead some saw her as corrupt and her killing was considered advantageous to both the military establishment and to the islamic fundamentalists who despised her bhutto was committed to democracy and modernisation and believed that the future of the islamic world lay in the embrace of these processes however allen thought that it was hard to pin down what bhuttos core political values actually were bhatia described bhutto as having liberal convictions and a selfevidently progressive outlook while suvorova thought that bhutto presented herself as the outpost of universal liberal values in conservative pakistan for a western audience bhutto biographer g s bhargava thought that in the context of pakistani politics she could pass for a social democrat her friend catherine drucker who knew her while the two women were at oxford university said bhuttos political views were then akin to those commonplace within the mild leftism of the day bhargava added that through her education in governance and politics at harvard and then oxford bhutto had a thorough exposure to political theory and practice in historical perspective as well as in the contemporary setting bhutto admired the thatcherite economic policies pursued by prime minister margaret thatcher in the united kingdom she was according to biographer mushtaq ahmed a zealous convert to privatisation and market economics bhutto advocated the creation of an expanded economically and politically stable middle class in pakistan believing that this was needed in order to sustain a stable democratic state allen commented that although the ppp had once been officially socialist in ideology bhutto was not a natural socialist or even as adept at talking the talk as zulfikar had been she disagreed with her fathers socialist economic policies and when in power sought to privatise various industries that had been nationalised in the 1970s ahmed thus suggested that while under bhutto the ppp continued to profess ideals of egalitarianism and claimed it would enhance the welfare of peasants and workers such progressive phraseology couched an absence of economic policies to benefit the poor instead ahmed thought its policies primarily benefited the privileged classes and was thus a rightwing rather than leftwing party during her years in office bhutto also did nothing to seriously challenge the feudal nature of rural pakistan under bhutto ahmed wrote people from the wealthy feudal class dominated the ppp both at the federal and provincial levels bhargava suggested that because of the period in which she was operating bhutto did not need to engage in the verbal radicalism employed by her father not needing to clamor for a socialist identity in order to win votes and allowing her to be a pragmatist in both word and deed lamb described bhutto at being skilled in using populist strategies in election campaigns in a 2007 article for the los angeles times bhuttos niece fatima bhutto called her a puppet democrat linked to the us governments neoconservative agenda under bhuttos leadership the ppp was officially secular as were the governments which she led however in pakistan at the time the term secularisation was often understood not as reflecting the separation of religious institutions and the state but rather had connotations of atheism and irreligion thus suvorova argued bhutto opposed the secularisation of islamic societies bhutto also took a hard stance against militant islamism although she had to compromise with pakistans powerful islamist lobby she favored a secular government for the country allen wrote that at no time in her years in power did bhutto westernized though she was feel comfortable in seriously challenging pakistans islamists although during her campaigns she vowed to abolish the hudud restrictions on women that zia had introduced she never did so instead these were revoked by musharraf in 2006 bhutto was indignant when faced with sexism and regarded herself as an ardent supporter of womens rights however suvorova stated that she was never a feminist in theory or practice bhutto expressed the view that there were differences between male and female leaders and that women leaders are more generous and forgiving male leaders tend to be more inflexible and more rigid in contrast to those islamic clerics who insisted that her involvement in politics contrasted with islamic values she insisted that there was no conflict in her view it was mens interpretation of our religion that restricted womens opportunities not our religion itself islam in fact had been quite progressive towards women from its inception bhutto described her main role model as fatimah the daughter of the islamic prophet muhammad stating that she admired her piety wisdom and courage she also described the indian prime minister indira gandhi as a political inspiration according to bhutto biographer shyam bhatia bhutto possessed a desire to be liked and to be popular and for this reason was prepared to be all things to all people having a chameleonlike quality to blend into her environment muñoz concurred describing bhutto as a woman of contradictions suvorova similarly observed that bhutto presented herself differently when in the west compared to when she was in pakistan while in pakistan bhutto presented herself as a conservative muslim who always wore her head covered but as a student in oxford she had adopted a more liberal lifestyle tending to wear a tshirt and jeans and occasionally drinking wine as a politician she was conscious of how her image was presented in pakistan she dressed modestly was never photographed with a glass lest it is interpreted as containing alcohol and would refuse to shake mens hands in the country she also wore a white dupatta on her head to placate islamist opposition her mother and other female family members had not covered their hair in this manner the journalist christina lamb believed that in being raised in a wealthy and aristocratic family bhutto was unable to appreciate the struggles of pakistans poorest the islamic studies scholar akbar s ahmed who went to school with bhutto wrote that she was a pampered and precocious child bhatia claimed that at oxford where he first met her bhutto was spoilt selfobsessed and prone to throwing temper tantrums although at the same time was humorous and generous willing to pay for her friends meals whenever at a restaurant allen suggested that bhutto retained her characteristic de haut en bas arrogance a relic of her feudal upbringing arguing that her key character flaw had been a belief in the special almost sacred destiny of herself and the bhutto family and that accordingly while she spoke like a democrat\\xa0 she thought and felt as a dynast in later life bhutto was accused of being addicted to power although allen thought it more accurate to state that she was addicted to adulation suggesting that this stemmed from a narcissistic element to bhuttos personality familial charisma is rare but in benazirs case the bhutto name matters in that her fathers charisma easily transferred to her she had her own charisma when she emerged in the 1980s as a young articulate welleducated and wellspoken woman her chief assets were her intelligence her confidence and the fact that she could talk to people of various backgrounds with empathy she had the rare quality of humor which she never lost in spite of leading an uncertain and challenging life above all she could use the media effectively her faults as a political leader were many too many stories of corruption stuck to her she was not a good administrator she was too inclined to listen to her small kitchen cabinet which very often consisted of people who would say what they thought she wanted to hear she became prime minister at a particularly young age and had no prior political or other cabinet experience — islamic studies scholar akbar s ahmed 2008 commentators and biographers have said that bhutto shared her fathers charisma but also his arrogance and that like him she was impatient with criticism the connection between bhutto and her father was endorsed by allen who stated that they had much in common strength charisma political instinct and the courage part and parcel of their arrogance that was so characteristic of both allen also believed that bhutto was so dedicated to her father that psychologically she was unable to admit to any imperfection in him after his death she repeatedly presented his execution as a martyrdom bhutto imitated many of her fathers mannerisms and his style of speech the journalist carla hall referred to her having a vaguely british accent she was an accomplished orator having honed her skill at public speaking while president of the oxford debating society having encountered her later in life muñoz regarded bhutto as a charming and intelligent woman close friends called her bb a name with which she signed some of her personal letters her parents gave her the childhood nickname of pinkie possibly alluding to her rosy complexion allen described bhutto as a woman of action rather than an intellectual bhuttos choice of reading material was usually either utilitarian or pleasurable rather than intellectual she enjoyed reading mills  boon romance novels and the celebrityfocused hello magazine she read a number of selfhelp books telling a friend that for all the lows in my life those selfhelp books helped me survive i can tell you her father had also encouraged her to read the writings of various prominent political figures among them napoleon bonaparte otto von bismarck vladimir lenin mustafa kemal atatürk and mao zedong she had a love of french and italian cuisine and was a great fan of the music of american singer neil diamond in a 2002 interview with the guardian bhutto described her allegiance to the sufi branch of sunni islam allen thought her to have some genuine if unorthodox religious belief mixed up with superstition bhargava stated that bhutto was dedicated and devout in her religious principles but modern and emancipated in her behavior and outlook  in conversation she often used the phrase inshallah and insisted that the quran supported the equality of the sexes bhutto was antiabortion and spoke forcefully against abortion most notably at the 1994 meeting of the international conference on population and development in cairo where she accused the west of seeking to impose adultery abortion intercourse education and other such matters on individuals societies and religions which have their own social ethos bhutto was the oldest of four children of these her younger sister sanam or sunny remained close to her throughout her life on returning to pakistan in 1987 bhuttos mother arranged for her marriage to the businessman asif ali zardari many of her friends were surprised that bhutto acquiesced to islamic tradition given her liberal attitudes however she later related that she felt obligations to my family and my religion to go through with it and that her high public profile made it difficult for her to find a husband through other means she consistently presented an image of respect and loyalty for her husband throughout the many accusations and periods of imprisonment he faced allen commented that it would probably never be known how happy the couples marriage was for bhutto always projected support and loyalty for her unpopular mate in the final years of bhuttos life she and her husband lived apart according to allen she would have been aware that a divorce or a public separation would have resulted in the end of her political career in pakistan due to social stigma around the subject in a 2007 interview bhutto said that she and her husband were living apart because of his medical requirements adding that she visited him every month in new york regarding the rumors of separation in 2008 bhuttos friend victoria schofield said that the marriage should not be judged by ordinary standards according to schofield after zardaris return from prison the bhuttos marriage was going through a process of readjustment in 2018 bhuttos friend ron suskind described the marriage as probably not all bad although added that bhutto did not consider her husband to be an equal partner in the marriage the couple had three children a son bilawal was born in september 1988 while she was campaigning for that years election she also had two daughters bakhtawar born on 25 january 1990 and aseefa born on 3 february 1993 when she gave birth to bakhtawar she became the first elected head of government to give birth while in office bhutto was devoted to her father and husband in later life she increasingly came to see success through the prism of her family the benazir bhutto of 1988 was a uniting figure for her country that of twenty years later a divisive one in retrospect her best and worst qualities seem so intimately linked that the course of her career might almost have been predicted — biographer brooke allen 2016 muñoz described bhutto as one of pakistans most important political figures a respected world leader and the leading stateswoman in the islamic world allen suggested that although bhuttos record in office was that of a corrupt compromised politician she displayed admirable qualities especially valor in the face of opposition within the islamic world bhutto was often regarded as a genuine muslim political leader and recognised as the head of pakistans most popular political party bhargava expressed the view that at the time of her initial election bhuttos personal popularity was tremendous larger than any that her father had previously achieved with suvorova suggesting that at this point in her life bhutto was often regarded as a quasisaint by her supporters in 1996 the guinness book of records named her the most popular international politician of the year and she also received such awards at the french legion of honour and oxford universitys doctor honours causa at the same time there were many pakistanis who despised her disliking her popularity her ties to western nations and her modernizing agenda extremist sunni islamist elements opposed her because of their belief that female leaders are unislamic and because she was a shia muslim they maintained that her participation in politics meant associating with men to whom she was not related and that this compromised the modesty required by islam conservative clerical opponents also claimed that by being prime minister bhutto was failing her religious duty which was to focus her energies on having as many children as possible ahmed stated that bhutto was one of the very few political leaders who had been able to assume the iconic status of a political martyr in the west while simultaneously evoking strong sentiments in the muslim world he therefore contrasted her with contemporaries like iraqs saddam hussein who were popular domestically but hated in the west and those like egypts hosni mubarak who curried favor with western governments while alienating their domestic audience bhutto gained popularity in western nations in part because she could present herself as being part of their world speaking a high standard of english and having been educated at harvard and oxford while her western supporters sometimes had doubts about her ability to govern they generally viewed her as a progressive figure who could advance democracy and counterterrorism in pakistan allen commented that the cards might have been stacked in bhuttos favor—she was rich educated aristocratic the favored daughter of a very powerful father—nevertheless her achievement was a remarkable one given the maledominated environment of late20th century pakistani society mushtaq ahmed similarly believed that for a woman to win an election in a maledominated society was an achievement and that her victory over the forces of reaction and persecution was an unprecedented accomplishment in political history ahmed thought that the election of a female prime minister in a muslimmajority country served as a proclamation that islam was a forwardthinking religion he added that as a pioneering female leader bhutto had barely half a dozen parallels among them indira gandhi thatcher golda meir chandrika kumaratunga and corazon aquino comparisons with aquino were often made — and welcomed by bhutto — because both women had fought against a military dictatorship and spent time in exile\\nshe became a global icon for womens rights and inspired many pakistani girls and women by her example the pakistani womens rights activist malala yousafzai—who received the 2014 nobel peace prize—cited bhutto as a personal inspiration writing in the american prospect magazine the journalist adele m stan called bhutto an imperfect feminist commenting that despite her efforts towards womens rights these were sometimes offset by her compromises with pakistans islamists and her support of the talibans rise to power in neighbouring afghanistan assessing her legacy william dalrymple wrote in the guardian that its wrong for the west simply to mourn benazir bhutto as a martyred democrat since her legacy was far murkier and more complex despite her western and positive image in the world bhuttos controversial policies and support have made her legacy much more complicated benazir bhutto failed to revert the controversial hudood ordinance – a contentious presidential ordinance which suppressed womens rights making them subordinate to men in 2009 cbs news described her legacy as mixed and commented that its only in death that she will become an icon—in some ways people will look at her accomplishments through rosetinted glasses rather than remembering the corruption charges her lack of achievements or how much she was manipulated by other people jason burke writing in the guardian about benazir termed her both a victim as well as in part a culprit of its pakistans chronic instability several universities and public buildings in pakistan have been named after her the pakistani government honored bhutto on her birthday by renaming islamabads airport benazir bhutto international airport muree road of rawalpindi as benazir bhutto road and rawalpindi general hospital as benazir bhutto hospital prime minister yousaf raza gillani a member of bhuttos ppp asked musharraf to pardon convicts on death row on her birthday in honour of bhutto several months after bhuttos death a series of pakistani postage stamps were announced to mark her 55th birthday abdul sattar edhi ni lpp urdu عَبْد

comment on yousafzais un appearance amid a backlash against her in pakistans press and social media words from the speech were used as lyrics for speak out a song by kate whitley commissioned by bbc radio 3 and broadcast on international womens day 2017 on 8 october 2013 malala at the age of 16 visited the daily show with jon stewart an american television programme her first major late night appearance she was there as a guest to promote her book i am malala on the program they discussed her assassination attempt human rights and womens education she left jon stewart speechless when she described her thoughts after learning the pakistani taliban wanted her dead saying i started thinking about that and i used to think that the talib would come and he would just kill me but then i said if he comes what would you do malala then i would reply to myself malala just take a shoe and hit him but then i said if you hit a talib with your shoe then there would be no difference between you and the talib you must not treat others with cruelty and that much harshly you must fight others but through peace and through dialogue and through education then i said i will tell him how important education is and that i even want education for your children as well and i will tell him thats what i want to tell you now do what you want stewart visibly moved by her words ended the conversation saying i am humbled to speak with you stewart would again have her as a guest on the show after the 2015 charleston church shooting in which he started the show citing no jokes saying our guest is a incredible person who suffered unspeakable violence by extremists and her perseverance and determination through that to continue on is an incredibly inspiration and to be quite honestly with you i dont think theres anyone else in the world i would rather talk to tonight than malala so thats what well do and sorry about no jokes on 10 october 2014 yousafzai was announced as the corecipient of the 2014 nobel peace prize for her struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education having received the prize at the age of 17 yousafzai is the youngest nobel laureate yousafzai shared the prize with kailash satyarthi a childrens rights activist from india she is the second pakistani to receive a nobel prize after 1979 physics laureate abdus salam after she was awarded the nobel peace prize there was praise but also some disapproval of the decision a norwegian jurist fredrik heffermehl commented on being awarded the nobel prize this is not for fine people who have done nice things and are glad to receive it all of that is irrelevant what nobel wanted was a prize that promoted global disarmament adán cortés a college student from mexico city and asylum seeker interrupted yousafzais nobel peace prize award ceremony in protest for the 2014 iguala mass kidnapping in mexico but was quickly taken away by security personnel yousafzai later sympathised and acknowledged that problems are faced by young people all over the world saying there are problems in mexico there are problems even in america even here in norway and it is really important that children raise their voices in march 2018 yousafzai was the subject of an interview with david letterman for his netflix show my next guest needs no introduction speaking about the taliban she opined that their misogyny comes from a superiority complex and is reinforced by finding excuses in culture or literature such as by misinterpreting teachings of islam on the topic of her attackers yousafzai comments i forgive them because thats the best revenge i can have pointing out that the person who attacked her was a young boy she says he thought he was doing the right thing asked about the presidency of donald trump yousafzai said some of the things have really disappointed me like sexual harassment and the ban on muslims and racism she also criticised the trump administrations proposed budget cuts to education saying that education is the first step to eradicating extremism and ending poverty throughout the episode clips are shown of yousafzai acting as a tour guide for prospective students to her college lady margaret hall oxford in july 2021 amid a major offensive by the taliban insurgents yousafzai urged the international community to press for an immediate ceasefire in afghanistan and provide humanitarian aid to afghan civilians following the taliban takeover of kabul on 15 august 2021 she expressed concern about the fate of womens rights fearing that women in afghanistan would lose the social and educational gains that had been made during the previous afghan governments two decades yousafzai condemned the talibans ban on girls education beyond 6th grade and said the taliban will continue to make excuses to prevent girls from learning beyond primary school she said the taliban want to erase girls and women from all public life in afghanistan and asked leaders around the world to take collective action to hold the taliban accountable for violating the human rights of millions of women and girls yousafzai  had said that she did not understand why people had to marry after her own marriage in 2021 she said that she had not been against marriage but had concerns about it related to child marriage and forced marriage and unequal marriages where women make more compromises than men in her own marriage she felt that she had found a person who understood her values on 7 march 2022 malala yousafzai advocated for every womans right to decide to wear what she likes for herself from a burqa to a bikini come and talk to us about individual freedom and autonomy about preventing harm and violence about education and emancipation do not come with your wardrobe notes on 9 november 2021 yousafzai married asser malik a manager with the pakistan cricket board in birmingham her opposition to the policy of talibanisation made her unpopular among taliban sympathisers a dawn columnist said she was scapegoated by the failing state government and a journalist in the nation wrote yousafzai was hated by overzealous patriots who were keen to deny the oppression of women in pakistan her statements conflicted with the view that militancy in pakistan was a result of western interference and conservatives and islamic fundamentalists described her ideology as antipakistan in 2015 the all pakistan private schools federation appsf banned her autobiographical book i am malala at all pakistani private schools with the appsf president mirza kashif ali releasing his own book against her i am not malala his book accused yousafzai of attacking the pakistan armed forces under the pretence of female education described her father as a double agent and traitor and denounced the malala funds promotion of secular education however ali pointed out that the appsf had gone on a national strike when yousafzai was attacked by the pakistani taliban conspiracy theorists in newspapers and social media also alleged that yousafzai had staged her assassination attempt or that she was an agent of the us central intelligence agency cia many pakistanis view her as an agent of the west due to her nobel prize oxford education and residence in england another conspiracy theory alleges that yousafzai is a jewish agent farman nawaz argued in daily outlook afghanistan that yousafzai would have gained more fame in pakistan if she belonged to the province of punjab yousafzai is seen as courageous by some pakistanis on 29 march 2018 yousafzai returned to pakistan for the first time since the shooting meeting prime minister shahid khaqan abbasi she gave a speech in which she said it had been her dream to return without any fear yousafzai then visited her hometown mingora in swat district khyber pakhtunkhwa the appsf representing 173000 private schools in pakistan organised an i am not malala day on 30 march in response to what the federation said were her antiislam and antipakistan views yousafzai responded by saying i am proud of my religion and country many people in india have accused yousafzai of spreading the pakistani agenda over the kashmir conflict and being selective in condemning human rights abuses on 7 august 2019 following the indian revocation of the special status of jammu and kashmir yousafzai expressed her concern about the situation and appealed to the international community to ensure peace in jammu and kashmir on 14 september 2019 malala posted a tweet in which she said that a kashmiri girl told her i feel purposeless and depressed because i cant go to school i missed my exams on august 12 and i feel my future is insecure now however many twitter users pointed out that on 12 august 2019 it was eid aladha in india a public holiday when schools were closed across the country so an exam would not be even possible on that day after her tweet yousafzai was widely criticised on twitter including by some indian celebrities yousafzais memoir i am malala the story of the girl who stood up for education and was shot by the taliban cowritten with british journalist christina lamb was published in october 2013 by little brown and company in the us and by weidenfeld  nicolson in the uk fatima bhutto reviewing the book for the guardian called the book fearless and stated that the haters and conspiracy theorists would do well to read this book though she criticised the stiff knowitall voice of a foreign correspondent that is interwoven with yousafzais marie arana for the washington post called the book riveting and wrote it is difficult to imagine a chronicle of a war more moving apart from perhaps the diary of anne frank tina jordan in entertainment weekly gave the book a b writing malalas bravely eager voice can seem a little thin here in i am malala likely thanks to her cowriter but her powerful message remains undiluted a childrens edition of the memoir was published in 2014 under the title i am malala how one girl stood up for education and changed the world according to publishers weekly in 2017 the book had sold almost 2\\xa0million copies and there were 750000 copies of the childrens edition in print yousafzai was the subject of the 2015 documentary he named me malala which was shortlisted for the academy award for best documentary feature in 2020 an indian hindilanguage biographical film gul makai by h e amjad khan was released with reem sameer shaikh portraying her yousafzai authored a picture book malalas magic pencil which was illustrated by kerascoët and published on 17 october 2017 by march 2018 the bookseller reported that the book had over 5000 sales in the uk in a review for the guardian imogen carter describes the book as enchanting opining that it strikes just the right balance between heavyhanded and heartfelt and is a welcome addition to the frustratingly small range of childrens books that feature bame central characters rebecca gurney of the daily californian gives the book a grade of 45 out of 5 calling it a beautiful account of a terrifying but inspiring tale and commenting though the story begins with fantasy it ends starkly grounded in reality in march 2018 it was announced that yousafzais next book we are displaced true stories of refugee lives would be published on 4 september 2018 by little brown and companys young readers division the book is about refugees and includes stories from yousafzais own life along with those of people she has met speaking about the book yousafzai said that what tends to get lost in the current refugee crisis is the humanity behind the statistics and people become refugees when they have no other option this is never your first choice profits from the book will go to yousafzais charity malala fund she visited australia and criticized its asylum policies and compared immigration policies of the us and europe unfavourably to those of poor countries and pakistan the book was published on 8 january 2019 on 8 march 2021 a multiyear partnership between yousafzai and apple was announced she will work on programming for apples streaming service apple tv the work will span “dramas comedies documentaries animation and childrens series and draw on her ability to inspire people around the world” national

عبد القدیر خان 1 april 1936 – 10 october 2021 known as a q khan was a pakistani nuclear physicist and metallurgical engineer who is colloquially known as the father of pakistans atomic weapons programa an émigré muhajir from india who migrated to pakistan in 1952 khan was educated in the metallurgical engineering departments of western european technical universities where he pioneered studies in phase transitions of metallic alloys uranium metallurgy and isotope separation based on gas centrifuges after learning of indias smiling buddha nuclear test in 1974 khan joined his nations clandestine efforts to develop atomic weapons when he founded the khan research laboratories krl in 1976 and was both its chief scientist and director for many years in january 2004 khan was subjected to a debriefing by the musharraf administration over evidence of nuclear proliferation handed to them by the bush administration of the united states khan admitted his role in running a nuclear proliferation network\\xa0– only to retract his statements in later years when he leveled accusations at the former administration of pakistans prime minister benazir bhutto in 1990 and also directed allegations at president musharraf over the controversy in 2008 khan was accused of selling nuclear secrets illegally and was put under house arrest in 2004 after years of house arrest khan successfully filed a lawsuit against the federal government of pakistan at the islamabad high court whose verdict declared his debriefing unconstitutional and freed him on 6 february 2009 the united states reacted negatively to the verdict and the obama administration issued an official statement warning that khan still remained a serious proliferation risk after his death on 10 october 2021 he was given a state funeral at faisal mosque before being buried at the h8 graveyard in islamabad abdul qadeer khan was born on 1 april 1936 in bhopal a city then in the erstwhile british indian princely state of bhopal state and now the capital city of madhya pradesh he was a muhajir of urduspeaking pashtun origin his father abdul ghafoor was a schoolteacher who once worked for the ministry of education and his mother zulekha was a housewife with a very religious mindset his older siblings along with other family members had emigrated to pakistan during the partition of india in 1947 who would often write to khans parents about the new life they had found in pakistan after his matriculation from a local school in bhopal in 1952 khan emigrated from india to pakistan on the sind mail train partly due to the reservation politics\\u200a254\\u200a at that time and religious violence in india during his youth had left an indelible impression on his world view upon settling in karachi with his family khan briefly attended the d j science college before transferring to the university of karachi where he graduated in 1956 with a bachelor of science bsc in physics with a concentration on solidstate physics from 1956 to 1959 khan was employed by the karachi metropolitan corporation city government as an inspector of weights and measures and applied for a scholarship that allowed him to study in west germany in 1961 khan departed for west germany to study material science at the technical university in west berlin where he academically excelled in courses in metallurgy but left west berlin when he switched to the delft university of technology in the netherlands in 1965 in 1962 while on vacation in the hague he met hendrina henny reternik – a british passport holder who had been born in south africa to dutch expatriates she spoke dutch and had spent her childhood in africa before returning with her parents to the netherlands where she lived as a registered foreigner in 1963 he married henny in a modest muslim ceremony at pakistans embassy in the hague khan and henny together had two daughters dina khan  who is a doctor and ayesha khan in 1967 khan obtained an engineers degree in materials technology\\xa0– an equivalent to a master of science ms offered in englishspeaking nations such as pakistan\\xa0– and joined the doctoral program in metallurgical engineering at the katholieke universiteit leuven in belgium he worked under belgian professor martin j brabers at leuven university who supervised his doctoral thesis which khan successfully defended and graduated with a deng in metallurgical engineering in 1972 his thesis included fundamental work on martensite and its extended industrial applications in the field of graphene morphology in 1972 khan joined the physics dynamics research laboratory or in dutch fdo an engineering firm subsidiary of verenigde machinefabrieken vmf based in amsterdam from braberss recommendation the fdo was a subcontractor for ultracentrifuge nederland of the britishgermandutch uranium enrichment consortium urenco which was operating a uranium enrichment plant in almelo and employed gaseous centrifuge method to assure a supply of nuclear fuel for nuclear power plants in the netherlands soon after khan left fdo when urenco offered him a senior technical position initially conducting studies on the uranium metallurgy\\u200a87 uranium enrichment is an extremely difficult process because uranium in its natural state is composed of just 071 of uranium235 u235 which is a fissile material 993 of uranium238 u238 which is nonfissile and 00055 of uranium234 u234 a daughter product which is also a nonfissile the urenco group utilised the zippetype of centrifugal method to electromagnetically separate the isotopes u234 u235 and u238 from sublimed raw uranium by rotating the uranium hexafluoride uf6 gas at up to 100000 revolutions per minute rpm\\u200a49\\u200a khan whose work was based on physical metallurgy of the uranium metal\\u200a87\\u200a eventually dedicated his investigations on improving the efficiency of the centrifuges by 1973–74\\u200a140 frits veerman khans colleague at fdo uncovered nuclear espionage at almelo where khan had stolen designs of the centrifuges from urenco for the nuclear weapons programme of pakistan veerman became aware of the espionage when khan had taken classified urenco documents home to be copied and translated by his dutchspeaking wife and had asked veerman to photograph some of them in 1975 khan was transferred to a less sensitive section when urenco became suspicious and he subsequently returned to pakistan with his wife and two daughters khan was sentenced in absentia to four years in prison in 1983 by the netherlands for espionage but the conviction was later overturned due to a legal technicality ruud lubbers prime minister of the netherlands at the time later said that the general intelligence and security service bvd was aware of khans espionage activities but he was allowed to continue due to pressure from the cia with the us backing pakistan during the cold war this was also highlighted when despite archie pervez khans associate for nuclear procurement in the us being convicted in 1988 no action was taken against khan or his proliferation network by the us government which needed the support of pakistan during the soviet–afghan war henk slebos\\xa0nl a dutch engineer and businessman who had studied metallurgy with khan at the delft university of technology continued providing goods needed for enriching uranium to khan in pakistan through his company slebos research slebos was sentenced in 1985 to one year in prison but the sentence was reduced on appeal in 1986 to six months of probation and a fine of 20000 guilders though slebos continued to export goods to pakistan and was again sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of around €100000 was imposed on his company ernst piffl was convicted and sentenced to three and a half years in prison by germany in 1998 for supplying nuclear centrifuge parts through his company team gmbh to khans khan research laboratories in kahuta asher karni a hungariansouth african businessman was sentenced to three years in prison in the us for the sale of restricted nuclear equipment to pakistan through humayun khan an associate of a q khan and his pakland pme corporation upon learning of indias surprise nuclear test smiling buddha in may 1974 khan wanted to contribute to efforts to build an atomic bomb and met with officials at the pakistani embassy in the hague who dissuaded him by saying it was hard to find a job in paec as a metallurgist in august 1974 khan wrote a letter which went unnoticed but he directed another letter through the pakistani ambassador to the prime ministers secretariat in september 1974\\u200a140 unbeknownst to khan his nations scientists were already working towards feasibility of the atomic bomb under a secretive crash weapons program since 20 january 1972 that was being directed by munir ahmad khan a reactor physicist which calls into question of his fatherof claim\\u200a72\\u200a after reading his letter prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto had his military secretary run a security check on khan who was unknown at that time for verification and asked paec to dispatch a team under bashiruddin mahmood that met khan at his family home in almelo and directed bhuttos letter to meet him in islamabad\\u200a141\\u200a upon arriving in december 1974 khan took a taxi straight to the prime ministers secretariat he met with prime minister bhutto in the presence of ghulam ishaq khan agha shahi and mubashir hassan where he explained the significance of highly enriched uranium with the meeting ending with bhuttos remark he seems to make sense\\u200a140–141\\u200a\\u200a60–61 the next day khan met with munir ahmad and other senior scientists where he focused the discussion on production of highly enriched uranium heu against weapongrade plutonium and explained to bhutto why he thought the idea of plutonium would not work\\u200a143–144\\u200a later khan was advised by several officials in the bhutto administration to remain in the netherlands to learn more about centrifuge technology but continue to provide consultation on the project706 enrichment program led by mahmood\\u200a143–144\\u200a by december 1975 khan was given a transfer to a less sensitive section when urenco became suspicious of his indiscreet open sessions with mahmood to instruct him on centrifuge technology khan began to fear for his safety in the netherlands ultimately insisting on returning home\\u200a147 in april 1976 khan joined the atomic bomb program and became part of the enrichment division initially collaborating with khalil qureshi\\xa0– a physical chemist\\u200a62–63\\u200a calculations performed by him were valuable contributions to centrifuges and a vital link to nuclear weapon research but continue to push for his ideas for feasibility of weapongrade uranium even though it had a low priority with most efforts still aimed to produce militarygrade plutonium\\u200a73–74\\u200a because of his interest in uranium metallurgy and his frustration at having been passed over for director of the uranium division the job was instead given to bashiruddin mahmood khan refused to engage in further calculations and caused tensions with other researchers\\u200a147–148\\u200a khan became highly unsatisfied and bored with the research led by mahmood\\xa0– finally he submitted a critical report to bhutto in which he explained that the enrichment program was nowhere near success\\u200a62–63 upon reviewing the report bhutto sensed a great danger as the scientists were split between militarygrade uranium and plutonium and informed khan to take over the enrichment division from mahmood who separated the program from paec by founding the engineering research laboratories erl\\u200a63–64\\u200a\\u200a149–150\\u200a the erl functioned directly under the armys corps of engineers with khan being its chief scientist and the army engineers located the national site at isolated lands in kahuta for the enrichment program as ideal site for preventing accidents the paec did not forgo their electromagnetic isotope separation program and a parallel program was led by g d alam at the air research laboratories arl located at chaklala air force base even though alam had not seen a centrifuge and only had a rudimentary knowledge of the manhattan project\\u200a72–110\\u200a\\u200a144\\u200a during this time alam accomplished a great feat by perfectly balancing the rotation of the first generation of centrifuge to 30000 rpm and was immediately dispatched to erl which was suffering from many setbacks in setting up its own program under khans direction based on centrifuge technology dependent on urencos methods\\u200a75–76\\u200a khan eventually committed to work on problems involving the differential equations concerning the rotation around fixed axis to perfectly balance the machine under influence of gravity and the design of first generation of centrifuges became functional after khan and alam succeeded in separating the 235u and 238u isotopes from raw natural uranium\\u200a78–79\\u200a in the military circles khans scientific ability was well recognised and was often known with his moniker centrifuge khan\\u200a151\\u200a and the national laboratory was renamed after him upon the visit of president muhammad ziaulhaq in 1983 in spite of his role khan was never in charge of the actual designs of the nuclear devices their calculations and eventual weapons testing which remained under the directorship of munir ahmad khan and the paec the paecs senior scientists who worked with him and under him remember him as an egomaniacal lightweight given to exaggerating his scientific achievements in centrifuges at one point munir khan said that most of the scientists who work on the development of atomic bomb projects were extremely serious they were sobered by the weight of what they dont know abdul qadeer khan is a showman during the timeline of the bomb program khan published papers on analytical mechanics of balancing of rotating masses and thermodynamics with mathematical rigour to compete but still failed to impress his fellow theorists at paec generally in the physics community in later years khan became a staunch critic of munir khans research in physics and on many occasions tried unsuccessfully to belittle munir khans role in the atomic bomb projects their scientific rivalry became public and widely popular in the physics community and seminars held in the country over the years many of his theorists were unsure that militarygrade uranium would be feasible on time without the centrifuges since alam had notified paec that the blueprints were incomplete and lacked the scientific information needed even for the basic gascentrifuges\\u200a75–76\\u200a\\u200a145–146\\u200a calculations by tasneem shah and confirmed by alam showed that khans earlier estimation of the quantity of uranium needing enrichment for the production of weapongrade uranium was possible even with the small number of centrifuges deployed\\u200a77 khan produced the designs of the centrifuges from urenco however they were riddled with serious technical errors and while he bought some components for analysis they were broken pieces making them useless for quick assembly of a centrifuge its separative work unit swu rate was extremely low so that it would have to be rotated for thousands of rpms at the cost of millions of taxpayers money alam maintained though khans knowledge of copper metallurgy greatly aided the innovation of centrifugesclarify it was the calculations and validation that came from his team of fellow theorists including mathematician tasneem shah and alam who solved the differential equations concerning rotation around a fixed axis under the influence of gravity which led khan to come up with the innovative centrifuge designs\\u200a146\\u200a scientists have said that khan would have never got any closer to success without the assistance of alam and others the issue is controversial\\u200a79\\u200a khan maintained to his biographer that when it came to defending the centrifuge approach and really putting work into it both shah and alam refused\\u200a79–80 khan was also very critical of paecs concentrated efforts towards developing a plutonium implosiontype nuclear devices and provided strong advocacy for the relatively simple guntype device that only had to work with highenriched uranium – a design concept of guntype device he eventually submitted to ministry of energy moe and ministry of defense mod\\u200a152\\u200a khan downplayed the importance of plutonium despite many of the theorists maintaining that plutonium and the fuel cycle has its significance and he insisted on the uranium route to the bhutto administration when frances offer for an extraction plant was in the offing though he had helped to come up with the centrifuge designs and had been a longtime proponent of the concept khan was not chosen to head the development project to test his nations first nuclearweapons his reputation of a thorny personality likely played a role in this after india conducted its series of nuclear tests pokhranii in 1998 intervention by the chairman joint chiefs general jehangir karamat allowed khan to be a participant and eyewitness his nations first nuclear test chagaii in 1998 at a news conference khan confirmed the testing of the boosted fission devices while stating that it was krls highly enriched uranium heu that was used in the detonation of pakistans first nuclear devices on 28 may 1998 many of khans colleagues were irritated that he seemed to enjoy taking full credit for something he had only a small part in and in response he authored an article torchbearers which appeared in the news international emphasising that he was not alone in the weapons development he made an attempt to work on the teller–ulam design for the hydrogen bomb but the military strategists had objected to the idea as it went against the governments policy of minimum credible deterrence\\u200a108\\u200a khan often got engrossed in projects which were theoretically interesting but practically unfeasible in the 1970s khan had been very vocal about establishing a network to acquire imported electronic materials from the dutch firms and had very little trust of paecs domestic manufacturing of materials despite the government accepting paecs arguments for the long term sustainability of the nuclear weapons program\\u200a148\\u200a at one point khan reached out to the peoples republic of china for acquiring the uranium hexafluoride uf6 when he attended a conference there – the pakistani government sent it back to the peoples republic of china asking krl to use the uf6 supplied by paec\\u200a150–151\\u200a in an investigative report published by nuclear threat initiative chinese scientists were reportedly present at khan research laboratories krl in kahuta in the early 1980s in 1996 the us intelligence community maintained that china provided magnetic rings for special suspension bearings mounted at the top of rotating centrifuge cylinders in 2005 it was revealed that president ziaulhaqs military government had krl run a heu programme in the chinese nuclear weapons program khan said that krl has built a centrifuge facility for china in hanzhong city china also exported some of df11s ballistic missile technology to pakistan where pakistans ghaznavi and shaheenii borrowed from df11 technology in 1982 an unnamed arab country reached out to khan for the sale of centrifuge technology khan was very receptive to the financial offer but one scientist alerted the zia administration which investigated the matter only for khan to vehemently deny such an offer was made to him the zia administration tasked majorgeneral ali nawab an engineering officer to keep surveillance on khan which he did until 1983 when he retired from his military service and khans activities went undetected for several years after in 1979 the dutch government eventually probed khan on suspicion of nuclear espionage but he was not prosecuted due to lack of evidence though it did file a criminal complaint against him in a local court in amsterdam which sentenced him in absentia in 1985 to four years in prison upon learning of the sentence khan filed an appeal through his attorney s m zafar who teamed up with the administration of leuven university and successfully argued that the technical information requested by khan was commonly found and taught in undergraduate and doctoral physics at the university – the court exonerated khan by overturning his sentence on a legal technicality\\u200a35\\u200a reacting to the suspicions of espionage khan stressed that i had requested for it as we had no library of our own at krl at that time all the research work at kahuta was the result of our innovation and struggle we did not receive any technical knowhow from abroad but we cannot reject the use of books magazines and research papers in this connection in 1979 the zia administration which was making an effort to keep their nuclear capability discreet to avoid pressure from the reagan administration of the united states us nearly lost its patience with khan when he reportedly attempted to meet with a local journalist to announce the existence of the enrichment program\\u200a82\\u200a during the indian operation brasstacks military exercise in 1987 khan gave another interview to local press and stated the americans had been well aware of the success of the atomic quest of pakistan allegedly confirming the speculation of technology export at both instances the zia administration sharply denied khans statement and a furious president zia met with khan and used a tough tone promising khan severe repercussions had he not retracted all of his statements which khan immediately did by contacting several news correspondents in 1996 khan again appeared on his countrys news channels and maintained that at no stage was the program of producing 90 weaponsgrade enriched uranium ever stopped despite benazir bhuttos administration reaching an understanding with the united states clinton administration to cap the program to 3 enrichment in 1990 the innovation and improved designs of centrifuges were marked as classified for export restriction by the pakistan government though khan was still in possession of earlier designs of centrifuges from when he worked for urenco in the 1970s\\u200a156–158\\u200a in 1990 the united states alleged that highly sensitive information was being exported to north korea in exchange for rocket engines pakistans ghauri missile was based entirely on north koreas rodong1 as reflected in its technology the project was supported by benazir bhutto who consulted for the project with north korea and facilitated the technology transfer to khan research laboratories in 1993 on multiple occasions khan levelled accusations against benazir bhuttos administration of providing secret enrichment information on a compact disc cd to north korea these accusations were denied by benazir bhuttos staff and military personnel\\u200a113–114\\u200a between 1987 and 1989 khan secretly leaked knowledge of centrifuges to iran without notifying the pakistan government although this issue is a subject of political controversy in 2003 the european union pressured iran to accept tougher inspections of its nuclear program and the international atomic energy agency iaea revealed an enrichment facility in the city of natanz iran utilising gas centrifuges based on the designs and methods used by urenco the iaea inspectors quickly identified the centrifuges as p1 types which had been obtained from a foreign intermediary in 1989 and the iranian negotiators turned over the names of their suppliers which identified khan as one of them heinz mebus a german engineer and businessman and college friend of khan was named as one of the suppliers  acting as a middleman for khan in may 1998 newsweek reported that khan had sent iraq centrifuge designs which were apparently confiscated by the unmovic officials iraqi officials said the documents were authentic but that they had not agreed to work with a q khan fearing an isi sting operation due to strained relations between two countries in 2003 merchant vessel bbc china was caught carrying nuclear centrifuges to libya from malaysia the scomi group and khan research laboratories were supplying nuclear parts to libya through khans dubaibased sri lankan associate buhary syed abu tahir this was further revealed in the scomi precision engineering nuclear scandal surrounding scomi ceo shah hakim zain and kamaluddin abdullah\\xa0ms son of former malaysian prime minister abdullah ahmad badawi libya negotiated with the united states to roll back its nuclear program to have economic sanctions lifted effected by the iran and libya sanctions act and shipped centrifuges to the united states that were identified as p1 models by the american inspectors ultimately the bush administration launched its investigation of khan focusing on his personal role when libya handed over a list of its suppliers friedrich tinner a nuclear engineer and friend of khan since their days at the leuven university was one of the heads of libyas nuclear programme and worked in nuclear enrichment for libya and pakistan in 2008 german nuclear engineer gotthard lerch\\xa0de was convicted and sentenced to five years and six months in prison for procuring centrifuges for libya from khan lerch also acted as khans middleman for iran alfred hempel a german businessman arranged the shipment of gas centrifuge parts from khan in pakistan to libya and iran via dubai the a q khan network involved numerous shell companies setup by khan in dubai to obtain equipment necessary for nuclear enrichment shahid bagheri industrial group\\xa0ko of irans defense industries organization was involved in nuclear proliferation for iran and north korea through china parts needed for nuclear enrichment in pakistan were also imported by khan from several japanese companies starting in 2001 khan served as an adviser on science and technology in the musharraf administration and had become a public figure who enjoyed much support from his countrys political conservative sphere in 2003 the bush administration reportedly turned over evidence of a nuclear proliferation network that implicated khans role to the musharraf administration khan was dismissed from his post on 31 january 2004 on 4 february 2004 khan appeared on pakistan television ptv and confessed to running a proliferation ring and transferring technology to iran between 1989 and 1991 and to north korea and libya between 1991 and 1997 the musharraf administration avoided arresting khan but launched security hearings on khan who confessed to the military investigators that former chief of army staff general mirza aslam beg had given authorisation for technology transfer to iran on 5 february 2004 president pervez musharraf issued a pardon to khan as he feared that the issue would be politicised by his political rivals despite the pardon khan who had strong conservative support had badly damaged the political credibility of the musharraf administration and the image of the united states who was attempting to win hearts and minds of local populations during the height of the insurgency in khyber pakhtunkhwa while the local television news media aired sympathetic documentaries on khan the opposition parties in the country protested so strongly that the us embassy in islamabad had pointed out to the bush administration that the successor to musharraf could be less friendly towards the united states this restrained the bush administration from applying further direct pressure on musharraf due to a strategic calculation that it might cause the loss of musharraf as an ally\\nin december 2006 the weapons of mass destruction commission wmdc headed by hans blix stated that khan could not have acted alone without the awareness of the pakistan government blixs statement was also reciprocated by the united states government with one anonymous american government intelligence official quoted by independent journalist and author seymour hersh suppose if edward teller had suddenly decided to spread nuclear technology around the world could he really do that without the american government knowing in 2007 the us and european commission politicians as well as iaea officials had made several strong calls to have khan interrogated by iaea investigators given the lingering scepticism about the disclosures made by pakistan but prime minister shaukat aziz who remained supportive of khan and spoke highly of him strongly dismissed the calls by terming it as case closed in 2008 the security hearings were officially terminated by chairman joint chiefs general tariq majid who marked the details of debriefings as classified in 2008 in an interview khan laid the whole blame on former president pervez musharraf and labelled musharraf as the big boss for proliferation deals in 2012 khan also implicated benazir bhuttos administration in proliferation matters pointing to the fact as she had issued clear directions in this regard khan also said that he was persecuted because he was a muhajir khans strong advocacy for nuclear sharing of technology eventually led to his ostracisation by much of the scientific community but khan was still quite welcome in his countrys political and military circles\\u200a151\\u200a after leaving the directorship of the khan research laboratories in 2001 khan briefly joined the musharraf administration as a policy adviser on science and technology on a request from president musharraf in this capacity khan promoted increased defence spending on his nations missile program to counter the perceived threats from the indian missile program and advised the musharraf administration on space policy he presented the idea of using the ghauri missile system as an expendable launch system to launch satellites into space at the height of the proliferation controversy in 2007 khan was paid tribute by prime minister shaukat aziz on state television while commenting in the last part of his speech aziz stressed the services of nuclear scientist\\xa0 dr abdul qadeer khan are unforgettable for the country in the 1990s khan secured a fellowship with the pakistan academy of sciences – he served as its president in 1996–97 khan published two books on material science and started publishing his articles from krl in the 1980s gopal s upadhyaya an indian metallurgist who attended khans conference and met him along with kuldip nayar reportedly described him as being a proud pakistani who wanted to show the world that scientists from pakistan are inferior to no one in the world khan also served as project director of ghulam ishaq khan institute of engineering sciences and technology and briefly tenured as professor of physics before joining the faculty of the hamdard university where he remained on the board of directors of the

laboratories hospital after testing positive for covid19 khan died on 10 october 2021 at the age of 85 after being transferred to a hospital in islamabad with lung problems he was given a state funeral at the faisal mosque before being buried at the h8 graveyard in islamabad the prime minister of pakistan imran khan expressed grief over his death in a tweet adding that for the people of pakistan he was a national icon president of pakistan arif alvi also expressed sadness adding that a grateful nation will never forget his services during his time in the atomic bomb project khan pioneered research in the thermal quantum field theory and condensed matter physics while he coauthored articles on chemical reactions of the highly unstable isotope particles in the controlled physical system he maintained his stance of the use of controversial technological solutions to both military and civilian problems including the use of military technologies for civilian welfare khan also remained a vigorous advocate for a nuclear testing program and defence strength through nuclear weapons he justified pakistans nuclear deterrence program as sparing his country the fate of iraq or libya in an interview in 2011 khan maintained his stance on peace through strength and vigorously defended the nuclear weapons program as part of the deterrence policy pakistans motivation for nuclear weapons arose from a need to prevent nuclear blackmail by india had iraq and libya been nuclear powers they wouldnt have been destroyed in the way we have seen recently\\xa0 if pakistan had an atomic capability before 1971 we pakistanis would not have lost half of our country after a disgraceful defeat during his work on the nuclear weapons program and onwards khan faced heated and intense criticism from his fellow theorists most notably pervez hoodbhoy who contested his scientific understanding in quantum physics in addition khans false claims that he was the father of the atomic bomb project since its inception and his personal attacks on munir ahmad khan caused even greater animosity from his fellow theorists and most particularly within the general physics community such as the pakistan physics society various motivations have been cited for khans role in the proliferation of nuclear weapons according to the editorinchief of foreign policy moisés naím although his actions were certainly ideological or political in nature khans motives remain essentially financial this is evidenced according to him by his commercial maneuvers his presence in north korean trade as well as his real estate ownerships for instance khan owned the hendrina khan hotel in timbuktu named after his wife it was one of dozens of his commercial enterprises to build his hotel in timbuktu he reportedly used a pakistan air force c130 transport aircraft in the early 2000s to transport carved wooden furniture the plane landed at tripoli airport in libya and the cargo was then taken to timbuktu by road as it was unable to land in mali khan himself accompanied the furniture from islamabad his wife two daughters and brother abdul quyuim khan were all named in the panama papers in 2016 as owners of wahdat ltd an offshore company registered in the bahamas bruno tertrais a senior researcher at the foundation for strategic research states khans motivations were complex and evolving  the primary motivation seems to have been to ensure the legitimacy of his role in building pakistans nuclear force  the second motivation which has become more important over time is personal enrichment finally the third important element of varying importance depending on the hypothesis khans more or less diffuse desire to see other muslim countries access nuclear power in spite of the proliferation controversy and his volatile personality khan remained a popular public figure and has been as a symbol of national pride with many in pakistan who see him as a national hero while khan has been bestowed with many medals and honours by the federal government and universities in pakistan khan also remains the only citizen of pakistan to have been honoured twice with the nishaneimtiaz

issues also recommended a neutral but competent bureaucracy and administration of at federal level and the establishment of local governments in four provinces this proposal was met with hostility and led to nawaz sharifs dismissal of general karamat in turn this reduced nawazs mandate in public circles and led to much criticism from leader of the opposition benazir bhutto there were three lieutenantgenerals potentially in line to succeed general karamat as chief of army staff lieutenantgeneral ali kuli khan a graduate of pma and rma sandhurst was an extremely capable staff officer and wellliked in public circles but was seen as close to the former chief of army staff general retired abdul waheed kakar and was not promoted second in line was lieutenantgeneral khalid nawaz khan who

prime minister nawaz sharif personally promoted musharraf to the rank of fourstar general to replace karamat after the kargil incident musharraf did not wish to be the chairman of the joint chiefs musharraf favoured the chief of naval staff admiral bokhari to take on this role and claimed that he did not care prime minister sharif was displeased by this suggestion due to the hostile nature of his relationship with the admiral musharraf further exacerbated his divide with nawaz sharif after recommending the forced retirement of senior officers close to the prime minister including lieutenantgeneral tariq pervez also known by his names initials as tp commander of xii corps who was a brotherinlaw of a high profile cabinet minister according to musharraf lieutenantgeneral tp was an illmannered foulmouthed illdisciplined officer who caused a great deal of dissent within the armed forces nawaz sharifs announcement of the promotion of general musharraf to chairman joint chiefs caused an escalation of the tensions with admiral bokhari upon hearing the news he launched a strong protest against the prime minister the next morning the prime minister relieved admiral bokhari of his duties it was during his time as chairman of the joint chiefs that musharraf began to build friendly relations with the united states army establishment including general anthony zinni usmc general tommy franks general john abizaid and general colin powell of the us army all of whom were premier fourstar generals the pakistan army originally conceived the kargil plan after the siachen conflict but the plan was rebuffed repeatedly by senior civilian and military officials musharraf was a leading strategist behind the kargil conflict from march to may 1999 he ordered secret infiltration of forces into the kargil district after india discovered the infiltration a fierce indian offensive nearly led to a fullscale war however sharif withdrew support for the insurgents in july because of heightened international pressure sharifs decision antagonised the pakistan army and rumours of a possible coup began emerging soon afterward sharif and musharraf dispute on who was responsible for the kargil conflict and pakistans withdrawal this strategic operation met with great hostility in the public circles and wide scale disapproval in the media who roundly criticised this operation musharraf had severe confrontation and became involved in serious altercations with his senior officers chief of naval staff admiral fasih bokhari chief of air staff air chief marshal pq mehdi and senior lieutenantgeneral ali kuli khan admiral bokhari ultimately demanded a fullfledged jointservice court martial against general musharraf while on the other hand general kuli khan lambasted the war as a disaster bigger than the eastpakistan tragedy adding that the plan was flawed in terms of its conception tactical planning and execution that ended in sacrificing so many soldiers problems with his lifelong friend chief of air staff air chief marshal pervez mehdi also arose when air chief refrained to participate or authorise any air strike to support the elements of army operations in the kargil region during the last meeting with the prime minister musharraf faced grave criticism on results produced by kargil infiltration by the principal military intelligence mi director lieutenantgeneral jamshed gulzar kiani who maintained in the meeting  whatever has been written there is against logic if you catch your enemy by the jugular vein he would react with full force if you cut enemy supply lines the only option for him will be to ensure supplies by air sic at that situation the indian army was unlikely to confront and it had to come up to the occasion it is against wisdom that you dictate to the enemy to keep the war limited to a certain front nawaz sharif has maintained that the operation was conducted without his knowledge however details of the briefing he got from the military before and after the kargil operation have become public before the operation between january and march sharif was briefed about the operation in three separate meetings in january the army briefed him about the indian troop movement along the loc in skardu on 29 january 1999 on 5 february at kel on 12 march at the ghq and finally on 17 may at the isi headquarters during the end of the june dcc meeting a tense sharif turned to the army chief and said you should have told me earlier musharraf pulled out his notebook and repeated the dates and contents of around seven briefings he had given him since the beginning of january military officials from musharrafs joint staff headquarters js hq met with regional corps commanders three times in

third replacement of the top military commander of the country in less than two years local military commanders began to mobilise troops towards islamabad from nearby rawalpindi the military placed

the airport control tower at 250\\xa0am on 13 october musharraf addressed the nation with a recorded message musharraf met with president rafiq tarar on 13 october to deliberate on legitimising the coup on 15 october musharraf ended emerging hopes of a quick transition to democracy after he declared a state of emergency suspended the constitution and assumed power as chief executive he also

obtain the office of the prime minister the prime ministers secretariat official residence of prime minister of pakistan was closed by the military police and its staff was fired by musharraf immediately there were no organised protests within the country to the coup that was widely criticised by the international community consequently pakistan was suspended from the commonwealth of nations sharif was put under house arrest and later exiled to saudi arabia on his personal request and under a contract the senior military appointments in the interservices were extremely important and crucial for musharraf to keep the legitimacy and the support for his coup in the joint interservices starting with the paf musharraf pressured president tarar to appoint mostjunior air marshal to fourstar rank particularly someone with musharraf had experienced working during the interservices operations once airchief marshal pervez kureshi was retired the most junior air marshal muschaf mir

show trial sources from pakistan claimed that musharraf and his military governments officers were in full mood to exercise tough conditions on sharif and intended to send nawaz sharif to the gallows to face a similar fate to that of zulfikar ali bhutto in 1979 it was the pressure on musharraf exerted by saudi arabia and the united states to exile sharif after it was confirmed that the court is about to give its verdict on nawaz sharif over treason charges and the court would sentence sharif to death sharif signed an agreement with musharraf and his military government and his family was exiled to saudi arabia in december 2000 shortly after musharrafs takeover musharraf issued oath of judges order no 2000 which required judges to take a fresh oath of office on 12 may 2000 the supreme

of pakistan musharraf was the first military president to accept the rulings of the supreme court and holding free and fair elections in 2002 part of his vision to return democratic rule to the country in october 2002 pakistan held general elections which the promusharraf pmlq won wide margins although it had failed to gain an absolute majority the pmlq formed a government with farright religious parties coalition the mma and the liberals mqm the coalition legitimised musharrafs rule after the elections the pmlq nominated zafarullah khan jamali for the office of prime minister which musharraf also approved after first session at the parliament musharraf voluntarily transferred the powers of chief executive to prime minister zafarullah khan jamali musharraf succeeded to pass the xvii amendment which grants powers to dissolve the parliament with approval required from the supreme court within two years jamali proved to be an ineffective prime minister as he forcefully implemented his policies in the country and caused problems with the business class elites musharraf accepted the resignation of jamali and asked his close colleague chaudhry shujaat hussain to appoint a new prime minister in place hussain nominated finance minister shaukat aziz who had been impressive due to his performance as finance minister in 1999 musharraf regarded aziz as his right hand and preferable choice for the office of prime minister with aziz appointed as prime minister musharraf transferred all executive powers to aziz as he trusted shaukat aziz aziz proved to be extremely capable in running the government under his leadership economic growth reached to a maximum level which further stabilised musharrafs presidency aziz swiftly quietly and quickly undermined the elements seeking to undermine musharraf which became a factor in musharrafs trust in him between 2004 and 2007 aziz approved many projects that did not require musharrafs permission in 2010 all constitutional changes carried out by musharraf and azizs policies were reverted by the 18th amendment which restored the powers of the prime minister and reduced the role of the president to levels below that of even the premusharraf era he suspended the countrys democratic process and imposed two states of emergency leading to his conviction for treason during his rule he implemented both liberal reforms and authoritarian measures while also forming alliances and impacting the situation in balochistan the legacy of musharrafs era serves as a cautionary tale for future leaders in pakistan the president musharraf stood clapping his hands right next to us as we sang azadi and jazba and moved to the beat with us it was such a relief to have a coolest leader in the office the presidency of pervez musharraf helped bring the liberal forces to the national level and into prominence for the first time in the history of pakistan he granted national amnesty to the political workers of the liberal parties like muttahida qaumi movement and pakistan muslim league q and supported mqm in becoming a central player in the government musharraf disbanded the cultural policies of the previous prime minister nawaz sharif and quickly adopted benazir bhuttos cultural policies after disbanding indian channels in the country his cultural policies liberalised pakistans media and he issued many television licences to the privatesector to open television centres and media houses the television dramas film industry theatre music and literature activities were personally encouraged by pervez musharraf under his policies the rock music bands gained a following in the country and many concerts were held each week his cultural policies the film theatre rock and folk music and television programs were extremely devoted to and promoted the national spirit of the country in 2001 musharraf got on stage with the rock music band junoon and sang the national song with the band on political fronts musharraf faced fierce opposition from the ultraconservative alliance the mma led by clergyman maulana noorani in pakistan maulana noorani was remembered as a mystic religious leader and had preached spiritual aspects of islam all over the world as part of the world islamic mission although the political deadlock posed by maulana noorani was neutralised after nooranis death musharraf yet had to face the opposition from ard led by benazir bhutto of the ppp on 18 september 2005 musharraf made a speech before a broad based audience of jewish leadership sponsored by the american jewish congresss council for world jewry in new york city he was widely criticised by middle eastern leaders but was met with some praise among jewish leadership musharraf allied with the united states against the taliban in afghanistan after the september 11 attacks as the closest state to the taliban government musharraf was in negotiations with them in the aftermath of the attacks regarding the severity of the situation before allying with the us and declaring to stamp out extremism he was however criticised by nato and the afghan government of not doing enough to prevent pro taliban or alqaeda militants in the pakistanafghanistan border region tensions with afghanistan increased in 2006 with hamid karzai then president of afghanistan accusing musharraf of failing to act against afghan taliban leaders in pakistan claiming that the taliban leader mullah omar was based in quetta pakistan in response musharraf hit back saying none of this is true and karzai knows it george w bush encouraged the two leaders to unite in the war on terror during a trio meeting violence in the khyber pakhtunkhwa escalated in the late 2000s amid fighting between militants and pakistani soldiers backed by the us after the 2001 gujarat earthquake musharraf expressed his sympathies to indian prime minister atal bihari vajpayee and sent a plane load of relief supplies to india in 2004 musharraf began a series of talks with india to resolve the kashmir dispute in 2004 a ceasefire was agreed upon along the line of control many troops still patrol the border in 2006 king abdullah of saudi arabia visited pakistan for the first time as king musharraf honoured king abdullah with the nishanepakistan musharraf received the king abdulaziz medallion in 2007 from september 2001 until his resignation in 2007 from the military musharrafs presidency was affected by scandals relating to nuclear weapons which were detrimental to his authoritative legitimacy in the country and in the international community in october 2001 musharraf authorised a sting operation led by fia to arrest two physicists sultan bashiruddin mahmood and chaudhry abdul majeed because of their supposed connection with the taliban after they secretly visited talibancontrolled afghanistan in 2000 the local pakistani media widely circulated the reports that mahmood had a meeting with osama bin laden where bin laden had shown interest in building a radiological weapon it was later discovered that neither scientist had any indepth knowledge of the technology in december 2001 musharraf authorised security hearings and the two scientists were taken into the custody by the jag branch jag security hearings continued until early 2002 another scandal arose as a consequence of disclosure by pakistani nuclear physicist abdul qadeer khan on 27 february 2001 musharraf spoke highly of khan at a state dinner in islamabad and he personally approved khans appointment as science advisor to the government in 2004 musharraf relieved abdul qadeer khan from his post and initially denied knowledge of the governments involvement in nuclear proliferation despite khans claim that musharraf was the big boss of the proliferation ring following this musharraf authorised a national security hearing which continued until his resignation from the army in 2007 according to zahid malik musharraf and the military establishment at that time acted against abdul qadeer khan in an attempt to prove the loyalty of pakistan to the united states and western world the investigations backfired on musharraf and public opinion turned against him the populist ard movement which included the major political parties such as the pml and the ppp used the issue to bring down musharrafs presidency the debriefing of abdul qadeer khan severely damaged musharrafs own public image and his political prestige in the country he faced bitter domestic criticism for attempting to vilify khan specifically from opposition leader benazir bhutto in an interview to daily times bhutto maintained that khan had been a scapegoat in the nuclear proliferation scandal and said that she didnt believe that such a big scandal could have taken place under the nose of general musharraf musharrafs longstanding ally the mqm published criticism of musharraf over his handling of abdul qadeer khan the ard movement and the political parties further tapped into the public anger and mass demonstrations against musharraf the credibility of the united states was also badly damaged the us itself refrained from pressuring musharraf to take further action against khan while abdul qadeer khan remained popular in the country musharraf could not withstand the political pressure and his presidency was further weakened musharraf quickly pardoned abdul qadeer khan in exchange for cooperation and issued confinement orders against khan that limited khans movement he handed over the case of abdul qadeer khan to prime minister aziz who had been supportive towards khan personally thanking him the services of dr qadeer khan are unforgettable for the country on 4 july 2008 in an interview abdul qadeer khan laid the blame on president musharraf and later on benazir bhutto for transferring the technology claiming that musharraf was aware of all the deals and he was the big boss for those deals khan said that musharraf gave centrifuges to north korea in a 2000 shipment supervised by the armed forces the equipment was sent in a north korean plane loaded under the supervision of pakistan security officials nuclear weapons expert david albright of the institute for science and international security agreed that khans activities were governmentsanctioned after musharrafs resignation abdul qadeer khan was released from house arrest by the executive order of the supreme court of pakistan after musharraf left the country the new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee general tärik majid terminated all further debriefings of abdul qadeer khan few believed that abdul qadeer khan acted alone and the affair risked gravely damaging the armed forces which oversaw and controlled the nuclear weapons development and of which musharraf was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff until his resignation from military service on 28 november 2007 when musharraf came to power in 1999 he promised that the corruption in the government bureaucracy would be cleaned up however some claimed that the level of corruption did not diminish throughout musharrafs time musharraf instituted prohibitions on foreign students access to studying islam within pakistan an effort that began as an outright ban but was later reduced to restrictions on obtaining visas in december 2003 musharraf made a deal with mma a sixmember coalition of hardline islamist parties agreeing to leave the army by 31 december 2004 with that partys support promusharraf legislators were able to muster the twothirds supermajority required to pass the seventeenth amendment which retroactively legalised musharrafs 1999 coup and many of his decrees musharraf reneged on his agreement with the mma and promusharraf legislators in the parliament passed a bill allowing musharraf to keep both offices on 1 january 2004 musharraf had won a confidence vote in the electoral college of pakistan consisting of both houses of parliament and the four provincial assemblies musharraf received 658 out of 1170 votes a 56 majority but many opposition and islamic members of parliament walked out to protest the vote as a result of this vote his term was extended to 2007 prime minister zafarullah khan jamali resigned on 26 june 2004 after losing the support of musharrafs party pmlq his resignation was at least partially due to his public differences with the party chairman chaudhry shujaat hussain this was rumoured to have happened at musharrafs command jamali had been appointed with the support of musharrafs and the promusharraf pmlq most pmlq parliamentarians formerly belonged to the pakistan muslim league party led by sharif and most ministers of the cabinet were formerly senior members of other parties joining the pmlq after the elections upon being offered positions musharraf nominated shaukat aziz the minister for finance and a former employee of citibank and head of citibank private banking as the new prime minister in

field the national assembly voted in favour of the womens protection bill on 15 november 2006 and the senate approved it on 23 november 2006 president general pervez musharraf signed into law the womens protection bill on 1 december 2006 the bill places rape laws under the penal code and allegedly does away with harsh conditions that previously required victims to produce four male witnesses and exposed the victims to prosecution for adultery if they were unable to prove the crime\\nhowever the womens protection bill has been criticised heavily by many for paying continued lip service and failing to address the actual problem by its roots repealing the hudood ordinance in this context musharraf has also been criticised by women and human rights activists for not following up his words by action the human rights commission of pakistan hrcp said that the socalled womens protection bill is a farcical attempt at making hudood ordinances palatable outlining the issues of the bill and the continued impact on women his government increased reserved seats for women in assemblies to increase womens representation and make their presence more effective the number of reserved seats in the national assembly was increased from 20 to 60 in provincial assemblies 128 seats were reserved for women this situation has brought out increase participation of women in the 1988 and 2008

pronouncing captain hammad a fellow military man and the accused in the case innocent before the judicial inquiry was complete shazia alleged that she was forced by the government to leave the country in an interview given to the washington post in september 2005 musharraf said that pakistani women who had been the victims of rape treated rape as a moneymaking concern and were only interested in the publicity to make money and get a canadian visa he subsequently denied making these comments but the post made available an audio recording of the interview in which musharraf could be heard making the quoted remarks musharraf also denied mukhtaran mai a pakistani rape victim the right to travel abroad until pressured by us state department the remarks made by musharraf sparked outrage

suspension of chief justice iftikhar muhammad chaudhry and widely circulated criticisms from rivals benazir bhutto and nawaz sharif had brutalised the personal image of musharraf in public and

the trial was unconstitutional the unanimous verdict was delivered by a threemember bench of the lahore high court consisting of justice sayyed muhammad mazahar ali akbar naqvi justice muhammad ameer

khan was named one of time magazines 100 most influential people of 2019 in the section leaders in domestic economic policy khan inherited a twin balance of payments and debt crisis with a large current account deficit and fiscal deficit in 2018 khans government sought a bailout from the imf in exchange for the bailout khans government slashed subsidy spending in the energy sector and unveiled an austerity budget to curb the fiscal deficit and limit government borrowing also the imf demanded that the pakistani government depreciate the rupee and improve tax collection khans government decided to raise import tariffs to collect higher tax revenues and devalued the currency this alongside the heavy import duty helped to curtail the current account deficit see import substitution pakistans overall balance of payments position improved significantly following recordhigh remittances in 2020 which stabilised the central banks foreign exchange reserves the fiscal deficit narrowed to less than 1 of gdp by 2020 due to the governments austerity policies\\nthus the rate of debt accumulation had significantly slowed but pakistans debt remained high due to the high borrowing of previous governments in which the current government had to allocate 24 billion to pay off loans taken during the tenure of previous governments aside from imfmandated reforms khans government introduced policies to improve the business operating climate as a result pakistan climbed 28 places higher on the world banks ease of doing business index pakistan ranked amongst the top 10 most improved countries in 2019 pakistans tax collection also hit record highs in 2019 as the government raised more revenue from domestic taxes with no increase in tax revenue from import taxes given import compression had lowered the quantity being imported so the government collected less tax revenue from imports this trend continued into 2020 albeit at a slower pace the fiscal deficit was also controlled to less than 1 of gdp in the second half of 2020 pakistan recorded a primary surplus excluding interest payment and principal repayment of previous debt but was in deficit once the interest payment on debt was accounted for albeit the deficit was smaller economists primarily pinned this reduction in the fiscal deficit on an increase in nontax revenues rather than an increase in tax revenues for example from the higher prices consumers paid for oil from stateowned oil companies nevertheless tax revenues also went on an upward trajectory with pakistans tax agency fbr both exceeding its tax collection target and collecting a record amount for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021 in the calendar year 2020 in economic policy with respect to international trade from january 2020 khans government implemented the second phase of the china–pakistan free trade agreement these renegotiations with china led to concessionary rates by china on pakistani exports of goods and services to mainland china such as reduced tariffs or zero tariffs the negotiations were termed a significant milestone in the countrys foreign policy by expanding trade relations in a relationship traditionally dominated by defence and security matters in june 2018 before khan became prime minister the fatf placed pakistan onto its grey list and demanded a series of actions be taken by pakistan to remedy terror financing laws khans government had initially used constitutional provisions of presidential power held by arif alvi to issue ordinances temporary legislation via presidential decree and the country became compliant with 14 points on the fatf agenda subsequently a series of bills were presented in pakistans parliament to ensure the legislation would permanently remain in place beyond a temporary presidential decree minor parts of the legislation passed both the lower house and upper house of pakistans parliament with the support of khans ruling coalition and part of the opposition parties too however the oppositiondominated senate did not pass a significant portion of the fatf bills and walked out on crucial moments creating hurdles for khans government subsequently khan summoned a joint session of both upper and lower house of parliament in which the bills passed given the government held a majority and without the support of the opposition by october 2020 pakistan became successfully compliant on 21 out of 27 points on the fatf agenda an increase from the 14 points in february 2020 with the remaining 6 points outstanding reviewed in february 2021 in fatfs february 2021 review khans government had successfully implemented about 90 of the fatf agenda with 24 out of 27 points largely addressed and the remaining 3 out of 27 points partially addressed the fatf president remarked that as pakistan was progressing with its action plan so it is not the time to put a country on the blacklist in fatfs june 2021 review the khan government implemented more progress the fatf found that pakistan has now largely addressed 26 out of the 27 action items us state department spokesperson ned price praised pakistans progress but encouraged pakistan to tackle its remaining action item saying we do recognise and we support pakistans continued efforts to satisfy those first action plan obligations pakistan has made significant progress on its first action plan with 26 of 27 action items largely addressed — we encourage pakistan to continue working with the fatf and the international community to swiftly complete the remaining action item by demonstrating that terrorism financing investigations and prosecutions target senior leaders and commanders of undesignated groups he said on 8 april 2022 the khan government made progress on its remaining action plan by sentencing hafiz saeed a mastermind of the 2008 mumbai attacks and a undesignated terrorist to 31 years in prison due to the efforts of hammad azhar pakistan eventually made it out of the fatf greylist in october 2022 in national security policy khans government presided over an improved overall security climate with foreign investors expressing

international airlines reached breakeven in operating profit however the halt in air travel in the following year due to covid19 meant further reforms had to be made this led to a proposal to cut the airlines workforce almost by half in order to save costs and thus help the stateowned airline breakeven on a net profit level in addition to the operating profit level the national airline confirmed it would layoff employees in phases as part of pias restructuring plan in line with the governments policy of reversing the losses at stateowned companies khans government is set to axe many pia

the basis that no amnesty known as nro or national reconciliation ordinance in pakistani political parlance would be given to politicians or relatives who benefitted from a politicians patronage the campaign has been criticised for targeting khans political opponents nevertheless khans supporters argue that the campaign is genuine as senior members of khans own ruling party including jahangir khan tareen and aleem khan have faced investigation or prosecution with khan going as far as rejecting the formation of a judicial commission demanded by supporters of tareen under khans premiership the performance of pakistans anticorruption agency the national accountability bureau improved significantly when measured in terms of recovery of money in cases involving plea bargains andor convictions the recovery of the anticorruption agency had risen to rs 487 billion over three years from the start of 2018 to the beginning of 2021 this recovery was significantly higher than the

made a major contribution in quantum field theory and in the advancement of mathematics at imperial college london with his student riazuddin salam made important contributions to the modern theory on neutrinos neutron stars and black holes as well as the work on modernising quantum mechanics and quantum field theory as a teacher and science promoter salam is remembered as a founder and scientific father of mathematical and theoretical physics in pakistan during his term as the chief scientific advisor to the president salam heavily contributed to the rise of pakistani physics within the global physics community up until shortly before his death salam continued to contribute to physics and to advocate for the development of science in thirdworld countries abdus salam was born on 29 january 1926 in the punjab province of british india now in pakistan into an ahmadi muslim rajput family his grandfather gul muhammad was a religious scholar as well as a physician and his father choudhary muhammad hussain was a minor educational official and a teacher abdus salams father was stationed in a poor farming district in jhang where abdus salam spent his early years his birthplace is often given as jhang but he was in fact born in saktokdas in the sahiwal district where his mother hajira begums family was living and where she returned to give birth as was customary with the first child his sister was also born in saktokdas whereas his six brothers were all born in jhang the name choudhary muhammad hussain gave his son was abd alsalam which means servant of god abd means servant and salam is one the 99 names of god in the quran in english his name is usually transliterated as abdus salam which should be understood as a single given name his father followed the custom of not giving a surname later in his life he added mohammad to his name salam very early established a reputation throughout punjab for outstanding brilliance and academic achievement at age 14 salam scored the highest marks ever recorded for the entrance examination at the punjab university he won a full scholarship to the government college university of lahore salam was a versatile scholar interested in urdu and english literature in which he excelled after a month in lahore he went to bombay to study in 1947 he came back to lahore but he soon picked up mathematics as his concentration salams mentor and tutors wanted him to become an english teacher but salam decided to stick with mathematics as a fourthyear student there he published his work on srinivasa ramanujans problems in mathematics and took his ba in mathematics in 1944 his father wanted him to join the indian civil service ics in those days the ics was the highest aspiration for young university graduates and civil servants occupied a respected place in civil society respecting his fathers wish salam tried for the indian railways but did not qualify for the service as he failed the medical optical tests the results further concluded that salam failed a mechanical test required by railway engineers to gain a commission in the railways and that he was too young to compete for the job therefore the railways rejected  salams job application while in lahore salam went on to attend the graduate school of government college university he received his ma in mathematics from the government college university in 1946 that same year he was awarded a scholarship to st johns college cambridge where he completed a ba degree with double firstclass honours in mathematics and physics in 1949 in 1950 he received the smiths prize from cambridge university for the most outstanding predoctoral contribution to physics after finishing his degrees fred hoyle advised salam to spend another year in the cavendish laboratory to do research in experimental physics but salam had no patience for carrying out long experiments in the laboratory salam returned to jhang and renewed his scholarship and returned to the united kingdom to do his doctorate he obtained a phd degree in theoretical physics from the cavendish laboratory at cambridge his doctoral thesis titled developments in quantum theory of fields contained comprehensive and fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics by the time it was published in 1951 it had already gained him an international reputation and the adams prize\\nduring his doctoral studies his mentors challenged him to solve within one year an intractable problem which had defied such great minds as paul dirac and richard feynman within six months salam had found a solution for the renormalization of meson theory as he proposed the solution at the cavendish laboratory salam had attracted the attention of hans bethe j robert oppenheimer and dirac after receiving his doctorate in 1951 salam returned to lahore at the government college university as a professor of mathematics where he remained till 1954 in 1952 he was appointed professor and chair of the department of mathematics at the neighbouring university of the punjab in the latter capacity salam sought to update the university curriculum introducing a course in quantum mechanics as a part of the undergraduate curriculum however this initiative was soon reverted by the vicechancellor and salam decided to teach an evening course in quantum mechanics outside the regular curriculum while salam enjoyed a mixed popularity in the university he began to supervise the education of students who were particularly influenced by him as a result riazuddin remained the only student of salam who had the privilege to study under salam at the undergraduate and postgraduate level in lahore and postdoctoral level in cambridge university in 1953 salam was unable to establish a research institute in lahore as he faced strong opposition from his peers in 1954 salam took fellowship and became one of the earliest fellows of the pakistan academy of sciences as a result of 1953 lahore riots salam went back to cambridge and joined st johns college and took a position as a professor of mathematics in 1954 in 1957 he was invited to take a chair at imperial college london and he and paul matthews went on to set up the theoretical physics group at imperial college as time passed this department became one of the prestigious research departments that included well known physicists such as steven weinberg tom kibble gerald guralnik c r hagen riazuddin and john ward in 1957 punjab university conferred salam with an honorary doctorate for his contribution in particle physics the same year with help from his mentor salam launched a scholarship programme for his students in pakistan salam retained strong links with pakistan and visited his country from time to time at cambridge and imperial college he formed a group of theoretical physicists the majority of whom were his pakistani students at age 33 salam became one of the youngest persons to be elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 1959 salam took a fellowship at the princeton university in 1959 where he met with j robert oppenheimer and to whom he presented his research work on neutrinos oppenheimer and salam discussed the foundation of electrodynamics problems and their solution his dedicated personal assistant was jean bouckley in 1980 salam became a foreign fellow of the bangladesh academy of sciences early in his career salam made an important and significant contribution in quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory including its extension into particle and nuclear physics in his early career in pakistan salam was greatly interested in mathematical series and their relation to physics salam had played an influential role in the advancement of nuclear physics but he maintained and dedicated himself to mathematics and theoretical physics and focused pakistan to do more research in theoretical physics however he regarded nuclear physics nuclear fission and nuclear power as a nonpioneering part of physics as it had already happened even in pakistan salam was the leading driving force in theoretical physics with many scientists he continued to influence and encourage to keep their work on theoretical physics salam had a prolific research career in theoretical and highenergy physics salam had worked on theory of the neutrino – an elusive particle that was first postulated by wolfgang pauli in the 1930s salam introduced chiral symmetry in the theory of neutrinos the introduction of chiral symmetry played crucial role in subsequent development of the theory of electroweak interactions salam later passed his work to riazuddin who made pioneering contributions in neutrinos salam introduced the massive higgs bosons to the theory of the standard model where he later predicted the existence of proton decay in 1963 salam published his theoretical work on the vector meson the paper introduced the interaction of vector meson photon vector electrodynamics and the renormalisation of vector mesons known mass after the interaction in 1961 salam began to work with john clive ward on symmetries and electroweak unification in 1964 salam and ward worked on a gauge theory for the weak and electromagnetic interaction subsequently obtaining su2 × u1 model salam was convinced that all the elementary particle interactions are actually the gauge interactions in 1968 together with weinberg and sheldon glashow salam formulated the mathematical concept of their work while in imperial college salam along with glashow and jeffrey goldstone mathematically proved the goldstones theorem that a massless spinzero object must appear in a theory as a result of spontaneous breaking of a continuous global symmetry in 19678 salam and weinberg incorporated the higgs mechanism into glashows discovery giving it a modern form in electroweak theory and thus theorised half of the standard model in 1968 together with weinberg and sheldon glashow salam finally formulated the mathematical concept of their work in 1966 salam carried out pioneering work on a hypothetical particle salam showed the possible electromagnetic interaction between the magnetic monopole and the cviolation thus he formulated the magnetic photon following the publication of prl symmetry breaking papers in 1964 steven weinberg and salam were the first to apply the higgs mechanism to electroweak symmetry breaking salam provided a mathematical postulation for the interaction between the higgs boson and the electroweak symmetry theory in 1972 salam began to work with indianamerican theoretical physicist jogesh pati pati wrote to salam several times expressing interest to work under salams direction in response to which salam eventually invited pati to the ictp seminar in pakistan salam suggested to pati that there should be some deep reason why the protons and electrons are so different and yet carry equal but opposite electric charge protons are composed of quarks but the electroweak theory was concerned only with the electrons and neutrinos with nothing postulated about quarks if all of natures ingredients could be brought together in one new symmetry it might reveal a reason for the various features of these particles and the forces they feel this led to the development of pati–salam model in particle physics in 1973 salam and jogesh pati were the first to notice that since quarks and leptons have very similar su2 × u1 representation content they all may have similar entities they provided a simple realisation of the quarklepton symmetry by postulating that lepton number was a fourth quark colour dubbed violet physicists had believed that there were four fundamental forces of nature the gravitational force the strong and weak nuclear forces and the electromagnetic force salam had worked on the unification of these forces from 1959 with glashow and weinberg while at imperial college london salam successfully showed that weak nuclear forces are not really different from electromagnetic forces and two could interconvert salam provided a theory that shows the unification of two fundamental forces of nature weak nuclear forces and the electromagnetic forces one into another glashow had also formulated the same work and the theory was combined in 1966 in 1967 salam proved the electroweak unification theory mathematically and finally published the papers for this achievement salam glashow and weinberg were awarded the nobel prize in physics in 1979 the nobel prize foundation paid tribute to the scientists and issued a statement saying for their contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles including inter alia the prediction of the weak neutral current salam took the nobel prize medal to the house of his former professor anilendra ganguly who taught him at the sanatan dharma college in lahore and placed the medal around his neck stating mr anilendra ganguly this medal is a result of your teaching and love of mathematics that you instilled in me in the 1970s salam continued trying to unify forces by including the strong interaction in a grand unified theory abdus salam returned to pakistan in 1960 to take charge of a government post given to him by president ayub khan from her independence in 1947 after the partition of india pakistan has never had a coherent science policy and total expenditure on research and development was only 10 of pakistans gdp even the pakistan atomic energy commission headquarters was located in a small room and less than 10 scientists were working on fundamental physics concepts salam replaced salimuzzaman siddiqui as the science advisor and became first member technical of paec salam expanded the web of physics research and development in pakistan by sending more than 500 scientists abroad in 1961 he approached president khan to set up the countrys first national space agency thus on 16\\xa0september 1961 the space and upper atmosphere research commission was established with salam as its first director before 1960 very little work on scientific development was done and scientific activities in pakistan were almost diminishedclarify salam called ishfaq ahmad a nuclear physicist who had left for switzerland where he joined cern back to pakistan with the support of salam paec established paec lahore center6 with ishfaq ahmad as its first director in 1967 salam became a central and administrative figure to lead the research in theoretical and particle physics with the establishment of the institute of physics at quaideazam university research in theoretical and particle physics was engaged under salams direction physicists tackled the greatest outstanding problems in physics and mathematics and their physics research reached a point that prompted worldwide recognition of pakistani physicists from the 1950s salam had tried establishing highpowered research institutes in pakistan though he was unable to do so he moved paec headquarters to a bigger building and established research laboratories all over the country on the direction of salam ishrat hussain usmani set up plutonium and uranium exploration committees throughout the country in october 1961 salam travelled to the united states and signed a space cooperation agreement between pakistan and us in november 1961 the us national aeronautics and space administration nasa started to build a space facility – flight test center ftc – at sonmiani a coastal town in balochistan province salam served as its first technical director salam played an influential and significant role in pakistans development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in 1964 he was made head of pakistans iaea delegation and represented pakistan for a decade the same year salam joined munir ahmad khan – his lifelong friend and contemporary at government college university khan was the first person in the iaea that salam had consulted about the establishment of the international centre for theoretical physics ictp a research physics institution in trieste italy with an agreement signed with iaea the ictp was set up with salam as its first director at iaea salam had advocated the importance of nuclear power plants in his country it was due to his effort that in 1965 canada and pakistan signed a nuclear energy cooperation deal salam obtained permission from president ayub khan – against the wishes of his own government functionaries – to set up the karachi nuclear power plant also in 1965 led by salam the united states and pakistan signed an agreement in which the us provided pakistan with a small research reactor parri salam had a longheld dream to establish a research institute in pakistan which he had advocated for on many occasions in 1965 again salam and architect edward durell stone signed a contract for the establishment of the pakistan institute of nuclear science and technology pinstech at nilore islamabad in early 1961 salam approached president khan to lay the foundations of pakistans first executive agency to coordinate space research by executive order on 16 september 1961 the space and upper atmosphere research commission suparco was established with salam founding director salam immediately travelled to the united states where he signed a space cooperation agreement with the us government in november 1961 nasa built the flight test center in balochistan province during this time salam visited the pakistan air force academy where he met with air commodore brigadiergeneral wladyslaw turowicz – a polish military scientist and an aerospace engineer turowicz was made the first technical director of the space centre and a programme of rocket testing ensued in 1964 while in the us salam visited the oak ridge national laboratory and met with nuclear engineers salim mehmud and tariq mustafa salam signed another agreement with the nasa which launched a programme to provide training to pakistans scientists and engineers both nuclear engineers returned to pakistan and were inducted into suparco salam knew the importance of nuclear technology in pakistan for civilian and peaceful purposes but according to his biographers salam played an ambiguous role in pakistans own atomic bomb project as late as the 1960s salam made an unsuccessful proposal for the establishment of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant but it was deferred on economic grounds by ayub khan according to rehman salams influence in nuclear development was diminished as late as 1974 and he became critical of bhuttos control over science but salam personally did not terminate his connection with the scientists working in the theoretical physics division at paec as early as 1972–73 he had been a great advocate for the atomic bomb project but subsequently took a stance against it after he fell out with bhutto over the second amendment to the constitution of pakistan which declared the ahmaddiya denomination to be nonislamic in 1965 salam led the establishing of the nuclear research institute—pinstech in 1965 the plutonium pakistan atomic research reactor parri went critical under salams leadership in 1973 salam proposed the idea of establishing an annual college to promote scientific activities in the country to the chairman of paec munir khan who accepted and fully supported the idea this led to the establishment of the international nathiagali summer college on physics and contemporary needs insc where each year since 1976 scientists from all over the world come to pakistan to interact with local scientists the first annual insc conference was held on advanced particle and nuclear physics in november 1971 salam met with zulfikar ali bhutto in his residence and following bhuttos advice went to the united states to avoid the indopakistani war of 1971 salam travelled to the us and returned to pakistan with scientific literature about the manhattan project and calculations involving atomic bombs in 1972 the government of pakistan learned about the development status of the first atomic bomb completed under the indian nuclear programme  on 20 january 1972 salam as science advisor to the president of pakistan managed and participated in a secret meeting of nuclear scientists with former prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto in multan known as the multan meeting at this meeting bhutto orchestrated the development of a deterrence programme at the meeting only i h usmani protested believing that the country had neither the facilities or talent to carry out such an ambitious and technologically remanding project whilst salam remained quiet here bhutto entrusted salam and appointed munir khan as chairman of paec and head of the atomic bomb program as salam had supported khan a few months after the meeting salam khan and riazuddin met with bhutto in his residence where the scientists briefed him about the nuclear weapons program after the meeting salam established the theoretical physics group tpg in paec salam led groundbreaking work at tpg until 1974 an office was set up for salam in the prime ministers secretariat by order of bhutto salam immediately started to motivate and invite scientists to begin work with paec in the development of fission weapons in december 1972 two theoretical physicists working at the international centre for theoretical physics were asked by salam to report to munir ahmad khan the scientific director of the program this marked the beginning of the tpg reporting directly to salam the tpg in paec was assigned to conduct research in fast neutron calculations hydrodynamics how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave problems of neutron diffusion and the development of theoretical designs of pakistans nuclear weapon devices later the tpg under riazuddin began to directly report to salam and the work on the theoretical design of the nuclear weapon was completed in 1977 in 1972 salam formed the mathematical physics group under raziuddin siddiqui that was charged with tpg with carrying out research in the theory of simultaneity during the detonation process and the mathematics involved in the theory of nuclear fission following indias surprise nuclear test —pokhrani – in 1974 munir ahmad khan had called a meeting to initiate work on an atomic bomb salam was there and muhammad hafeez qureshi was appointed head of the directorate of technical development dtd in paec the dtd was set up to coordinate the work of the various specialised groups of scientists and engineers working on different aspects of the atomic bomb the word bomb was never used in this meeting but the participants fully understood what was being discussed in march 1974 salam and khan also established the wah group scientist that was charged with manufacturing materials explosive lenses and triggering mechanism development of the weapon following the setting up of dtd salam riazuddin and munir ahmad khan visited the pakistan ordnance factories pof where they held talks with senior military engineers led by pof chairman lieutenantgeneral qamar ali mirza it was there that the corps of engineers built the metallurgical laboratory in wah cantonment in 1976 salam remained associated with the nuclear weapons programme until mid1974 when he left the country after ahmadi were declared nonmuslims by the pakistani parliament his own relations with prime minister bhutto fell out and turned into open hostility after the ahmadiyya community was declared as notislamic he lodged a public and powerful protest against bhutto regarding this issue and gave great criticism to bhutto over his control over science in spite of this salam maintained close relations with the theoretical physics division at paec who kept him informed about the status of the calculations needed to calculate the performance of the atomic bomb according to norman dombey after seeing indian aggression the siachen conflict in northern pakistan followed by indias operation brasstacks in southern pakistan salam again renewed his ties with senior scientists working in the atomic bomb projects who had kept him informed about the scientific development of the program in the 1980s salam personally approved many appointments and a large influx of pakistani scientists to the associateship program at ictp and cern and engaged in research in theoretical physics with his students at the ictp in 2008 indian scholar ravi singh noted in his book the military factor in pakistan that in 1978 abdus salam with paec officials paid a secret visit to china and was instrumental in initiating industrial nuclear cooperation between the two countries although he had left the country salam did not hesitate to advise the paec and theoretical and mathematical physics group on important scientific matters and kept his close association with tpg and paec in 1964 salam founded the international centre for theoretical physics ictp trieste in italy and served as its director until 1993 in 1974 he founded the international nathiagali summer college insc to promote science in pakistan the insc is an annual meeting of scientists from all over the world who come to pakistan and hold discussions on physics and science even today the insc holds annual meetings and salams pupil riazuddin has been its director since its start in 1997 the scientists at ictp commemorated salam and renamed ictp as the abdus salam international centre for theoretical physics throughout the years he served on a number of united nations committees concerning science and technology in developing countries salam also founded the third world academy of sciences twas and was a leading figure in the creation of a number of international centres dedicated to the advancement of science and technology during a visit to the institute of physics at quaidiazam university in 1979 salam explained after receiving an award physicists believed there are four fundamental forces of nature the gravitational force the weak and strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic forcerelevant salam was a firm believer that scientific thought is the common heritage of mankind and that developing nations needed to help themselves and invest in their own scientists to boost development and reduce the gap between the global south and the global north thus contributing to a more peaceful world in 1981 salam became a founding member of the world cultural council although salam left pakistan he did not terminate his connection to home he continued inviting pakistans scientists to ictp and maintained a research programme for them many prominent scientists including ghulam murtaza riazuddin kamaluddin ahmed faheem hussain raziuddin siddiqui munir ahmad khan ishfaq ahmad and i h usmani considered him as their mentor and a teachercitation needed abdus salam was a very private individual who kept his public and personal lives quite separate he married twice first time to a cousin the second time as well in accordance with islamic law at his death he was survived by three daughters and a son by his first wife and a son and daughter by his second professor dame louise johnson formerly professor of molecular biophysics at oxford university two of his daughters are anisa bushra salam bajwa and aziza rahmancitation needed salam was an ahmadi who saw his religion as a fundamental part of his scientific work he once wrote that the holy quran enjoins us to reflect on the verities of allahs created laws of nature however that our generation has been privileged to glimpse a part of his design is a bounty and a grace for which i render thanks with a humble heart\\ncheck quotation syntax\\nduring his acceptance speech for the nobel prize in physics salam quoted verses from the quran and stated thou seest not in the creation of the allmerciful any imperfection return thy gaze seest thou any fissure then return thy gaze again and again thy gaze comes back to thee dazzled aweary 673–4\\nthis in effect is the faith of all physicists the deeper we seek the more is our wonder excited the more is the dazzlement for our gaze in 1974 the pakistan parliament made the second amendment to the constitution of pakistan that declared ahmadis to be nonmuslim in protest salam left pakistan for london after his departure he did not completely cut his ties to pakistan and kept a close association with the theoretical physics group as well as academic scientists from the pakistan atomic energy commission abdus salam died on 21 november 1996 at the age of 70 in oxford england from progressive supranuclear palsy his body was returned to pakistan and kept in darul ziafat where some 13000 men and women visited to pay their last respects approximately 30000 people attended his funeral prayers salam was buried in bahishti maqbara a cemetery established by the ahmadiyya community at rabwah punjab pakistan next to his parents graves the epitaph on his tomb initially read first muslim nobel laureate the pakistani government removed muslim and left only his name on the headstone they are the only nation to officially declare that ahmadis are nonmuslim the word muslim was initially obscured on the orders of a local magistrate before moving to the national level under ordinance xx of 1984 being an ahmadi he was considered a nonmuslim according to the definition provided in the second amendment to the constitution of pakistan his craving for nationalism is symbolized best by his wish to be buried in his own homeland he loved his country and its soil we projected him as a hero a father and role model for our young scientists salams work in pakistan has been far reaching and regarded as highly influential he is remembered by his peers and students as the father of pakistans school of theoretical physics as well as pakistans science salam was a charismatic and iconic figure a symbol among them of what they were working or researching toward in their fields his students fellow scientists and engineers remembered him as brilliant teacher and engaging researcher who would also influence others to do the same salam founded the space research commission of and was its first director in 1998 the government of pakistan issued a commemorative stamp to honour salam as part of its scientists of pakistan series his alma mater government college lahore now a university has the abdus salam chair in physics and abdus salam school of mathematical sciences named after him the abdus salam chair was also established in his honour at the syed babar ali school of science and engineering in the lahore university of management sciences he made a significant contribution towards the 2012 success in the search for the higgs boson salam has been commemorated by noted and prominent pakistani scientists who were also his students many scientists have recalled their college experiences ghulam murtaza a professor of plasma physics at the government college university and student of salam wrote when dr salam was to deliver a lecture the hall would be packed and although the subject was particle physics his manner and eloquence was such as if he was talking about literature when he finished his lectures listeners would often burst into spontaneous applause and give him a standing ovation people from all parts of the world would come to imperial college and seek dr salams help he would give a patient hearing to everyone including those who were talking nonsense he treated everyone with respect and compassion and never belittled or offended anyone dr salams strength was that he could sift jewels from the sand ishfaq ahmad a lifelong friend of salam recalls dr salam was responsible for sending about 500 physicists mathematicians and scientists from pakistan for phds to the best institutions in uk and usa in august 1996 another lifelong friend munir ahmad khan met salam in oxford khan who headed the nuclear weapons and nuclear energy programmes said my last meeting with abdus salam was only three months ago his disease had taken its toll and he was unable to talk yet he understood what was said i told him about the celebration held in pakistan on his seventieth birthday he kept staring at me he had risen above praise as i rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings as if he wanted to thank everyone who had said kind words about him dr abdus salam had deep love for pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country it became more and more difficult for him to come to pakistan and this hurt him deeply now he has returned home finally to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much may be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him after his death what we could not when he was alive we pakistanis may choose to ignore dr salam but the world at large will always remember him however salams legacy is often ignored in the pakistani education system despite his achievements according to the documentary salam the first  nobel laureate very few young pakistanis have heard of him and his name is not mentioned in pakistani school textbooks in 2020 a group of students belonging to the state youth parliament desecrated an image of salam that was present at a college in gujranwala while chanting slogans against the ahmadiyya community this deliberate effort to stifle mention of salam is attributed to salam belonging to the ahmadiyya muslim community who have faced statesponsored discrimination since the 1970s llc started formally researching and developing a film on the science and life of abdus salam in 2004 two years after the producers had conceived of the idea a fundraising teaser was released by kailoola productions to coincide with salams birth anniversary on 29 january 2017 the postproduction phase of this documentary film pending funding is estimated at us150000 the film salam the first  nobel laureate directed by the indianamerican documentary filmmaker anand kamalakar was announced in 2018 and released on netflix in october 2019 pilgrim films released the dream of symmetry in september 2011 their press release describes it as presenting the extraordinary figure of abdus salam who not only was an outstanding scientist but also a generous humanitarian and a valuable person his rich and busy life was an endless quest for symmetry that he pursued in the universe of physical laws and in the world of human beings dr salams genius was like a magic and there was always an element of eastern mysticism in his ideas that left one wondering how to fathom his genius salam was elected to the american academy of arts and sciences in 1971 the united states national academy of sciences in 1979 and the american philosophical society in 1992 in 1997 scientists at ictp renamed the institute as the abdus salam international centre for theoretical physics in the honour of salam salams services have been recognised in pakistan as his students have openly spoken and stressed the importance of science and technology in pakistan in 1999 per the recommendation of ishfaq ahmad the government of pakistan led the establishment of the abdus salam chair in physics at the government college university on 22 november 2009 the director of the abdus salam international centre for theoretical physics gifted the original nobel prize certificate to his alma mater in 2011 gcus salam chair in physics held a onedaylong conference that was attributed to abdus salam salams students ghulam murtaza pervez hoodbhoy riazuddin and tariq zaidi discussed the life and works of salam and brought to light his achievements in pakistan and physics while covering the media converge on salams tribute the news international referred to salam as the great pakistan scientist in 1998 the edward a bouchetictp institute was renamed as the edward bouchet abdus salam institute in 2003 the government of punjab created an institute of excellence for the mathematical sciences the abdus salam school of mathematical sciences in salams alma mater – government college university that it has taken nearly four decades for this country to honour a globally renowned scientist who was one of its own is a sad reflection of the priorities that hold sway here for dr salam was an ahmadi a persecuted minority in pakistan and his faith rather than his towering achievements was the yardstick by which he was judged in 2008 in an opinion piece daily times called salam one of the greatest scientist pakistan has ever produced in 2015 the academy of young researchers and scholars lahore renamed its library as the abdus salam library in the town of vaughan ontario canada near the headquarters of the canadian branch of the ahmadiyya community of which abdus salam was a member the community has named a street after him abdus salam street while at cern in geneva switzerland there is route salam additionally there are two annual abdus salam science fairs one held in canada and the other in the us each is organised as a national event for young scientists from the ahmadiyya community in an effort to motivate youth toward scientific endeavour on 6 december 2016 pakistans prime minister nawaz sharif approved the renaming of quaidiazam universitys qau physics centre to the professor abdus salam center for physics it was also announced that the professor abdus salam fellowship will be established which will include five annual fully funded pakistani phd students in the field of physics in leading international universities in november 2020 english heritage erected a blue plaque in salams honour in putney london at the house that was his london home for almost 40 years in june 2023 imperial college london announced the renaming of its imperial college central library as the abdus salam library in 1979 salam was awarded the 1979 nobel prize in physics along with glashow and weinberg for their contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles including inter alia the prediction of the weak neutral current salam received high civil and science awards from all over the world salam is recipient of first high civil awards – star of pakistan 1959 and the nishaneimtiaz 1979 – awarded by the president of pakistan for salams outstanding services to pakistan the national center for physics ncp contains an abdus salam museum dedicated to the life of salam and his work as he discovered and formulated the electroweak theory below is the list of awards that were conferred to salam in his lifetime the abdus salam award also called the salam prize is an award established to recognise high achievements and contributions in physical and natural sciences in 1979 riazuddin fayyazuddin and asghar qadir met with salam and presented the idea of creating an award to appreciate scientists resident in pakistan in their respective fields salam donated the money he had won as he felt that he had no right use for the prize money it was endowed by asghar qadir riazuddin and fayyazuddin in 1980 and it was first awarded in 1981 the winners are selected by a committee consisted of aghar qadir fayyazuddin riazuddin and others of the center for advanced mathematics and physics camp which administers the award the abdus salam medal is presented by the third world academy of sciences in trieste italy first given in 1995 the award is presented to the people who have served the cause of science in

the disputed area which was under indian control from the longstanding status quo the boundary of rann of kutch was one of the few undemarcated boundaries pending since the 1947 partition of india the rann of kutch alternately spelled as kuchchh is a large area of salt marshes that span the border between india and pakistan the area was originally part of the princely state of kutch which was acceded to india in presentday kutch region of gujarat both countries maintained few armed police posts scattered along the border pakistan planned to serve several purposes through this operation first was to assess the response of the indian government and military which was relatively unstable under the governance of prime minister lal bahadur shastri after the death of indias first prime minister jawaharlal nehru in 1964 and the loss in the 1962 sinoindian war the second objective was to draw indian armor southward to kutch away from the punjab and kashmir region one of the objectives was to test the united states protest over the use of ussupplied military equipment against the india which was a violation of pakistans commitment the pakistan army also got a rehearsal opportunity for the planned invasion of india later the same year in january 1965 pakistan claimed the area of rann of kutch on the basis of the sindh province pakistans paramilitary force indus rangers started activity and took control over the ruined fort of kanjarkot located on the northwest fringe of the rann pakistani indus rangers started patrolling below the indian claimed line by january 1965 and occupied an indian police post near the kanjarkot fort which was in violation of the longstanding status quo the regions terrain and communication network and logistics was favorable to pakistan with all the approaches to the rann of kutch from the indian side being more difficult than from pakistan the pakistani railway station situated at badin was 26 miles north of the indian claim line and karachi was 113 miles east from the badin where the pakistan armys 8 division was based pakistan was able to move the troops quickly and easily along the border line the nearest indian railway station at bhuj was located 110 miles from the border and the nearest indian army formation 31 infantry brigade situated at ahmedabad was 160 miles east of bhuj railway station in february 1965 bilateral talks for the negotiation failed the pakistan army equipped with usmade patton tanks struck the indian forces on 9th april pakistan launched a major offensive on the sardar post comprising a brigade strength on 24 april pakistan launched operation desert hawk a decisive thrust towards the indian posts in the area deploying an infantry division and two armored regiments equipped with patton tanks and field guns the pakistan army captured four more posts and claimed the whole kanjarkot stretch with poor logistics and inferior military hardware india had no other option than to retreat after offering decent resistance the british prime minister herold wilson proposed a ceasefire on 28 april both countries signed an agreement to settle the disputed border through international arbitration by the international court of justice on 30 june 1965 the ceasefire became effective on 1 july 1965 india and pakistan both agreed to demarcate the border by a threemember arbitration committee the possibility of the armed conflict escalation was avoided by the active interventions of the british prime minister and the united nations secretarygeneral both nations withdrew all troops from the disputed and held areas after the peace talks as of june 30 and a preconflict status as of january 1965 was established the dispute later on went for indopakistan western boundary case tribunal and was solved in 1968  the pakistan army decision makers assessed the indian armys strength and capability based on the minor success in the rann of kutch area and headed towards their next planned execution of operation gibraltar in august 1965 despite indias repeated protests against the use of usmade weaponry by pakistan against india the president of the united states lyndon b johnson took no effective action against pakistan this attack exposed the inadequacy of the indian state armed police to cope with armed aggression so after the end of the 1965 war the government of india formed the border security force as a unified central agency with the specific mandate of guarding indias international boundaries the border security force came into formal existence on 1 december

the 7th14th centuries the region was ruled by a series of hindu dynasties and kashmir shaivism arose in 1339 shah mir became the first muslim ruler of kashmir inaugurating the salatinikashmir or shah mir dynasty the region was part of the mughal empire from 1586 to 1751 and thereafter until 1820 of the afghan durrani empire in 1819 the kashmir valley passed from the control of the durrani empire of afghanistan to the conquering armies of the sikhs under ranjit singh of the punjab thus ending four centuries of muslim rule under the mughals and the afghan regime as the kashmiris had suffered under the afghans they initially welcomed the new sikh rulers however the sikh governors turned out to be hard taskmasters and sikh rule was generally considered oppressive protected perhaps by the remoteness of kashmir from the capital of the sikh empire in lahore the sikhs enacted a number of antimuslim laws which included handing out death sentences for cow slaughter closing down the jamia masjid in srinagar and banning the adhan the public muslim call to prayer kashmir had also now begun to attract european visitors several of whom wrote of the abject poverty of the vast muslim peasantry and of the exorbitant taxes under the sikhs high taxes according to some contemporary accounts had depopulated large tracts of the countryside allowing only onesixteenth of the cultivable land to be cultivated many kashmiri peasants migrated to the plains of the punjab however after a famine in 1832 the sikhs reduced the land tax to half the produce of the land and also began to offer interestfree loans to farmers kashmir became the second highest revenue earner for the sikh empire during this time kashmir shawls became known worldwide attracting many buyers especially in the west the state of jammu which had been on the ascendant after the decline of the mughal empire came under the sway of the sikhs in 1770 further in 1808 it was fully conquered by maharaja ranjit singh gulab singh then a youngster in the house of jammu enrolled in the sikh troops and by distinguishing himself in campaigns gradually rose in power and influence in 1822 he was anointed as the raja of jammu  along with his able general zorawar singh kahluria he conquered and subdued rajouri 1821 kishtwar 1821 suru valley and kargil 1835 ladakh 1834–1840 and baltistan 1840 thereby surrounding the kashmir valley he became a wealthy and influential noble in the sikh court in 1845 the first anglosikh war broke out according to the imperial gazetteer of india gulab singh contrived to hold himself aloof till the battle of sobraon 1846 when he appeared as a useful mediator and the trusted advisor of sir henry lawrence two treaties were concluded by the first the state of lahore ie west punjab handed over to the british as equivalent for one crore indemnity the hill countries between the rivers beas and indus by the second the british made over to gulab singh for 75 lakhs all the hilly or mountainous country situated to the east of the indus and the west of the ravi ie the vale of kashmir drafted by a treaty and a bill of sale and constituted between 1820 and 1858 the princely state of kashmir and jammu as it was first called combined disparate regions religions and ethnicities to the east ladakh was ethnically and culturally tibetan and its inhabitants practised buddhism to the south jammu had a mixed population of hindus muslims and sikhs in the heavily populated central kashmir valley the population was overwhelmingly muslim—mostly sunni however there was also a small but influential hindu minority the brahmin kashmiri pandits to the northeast sparsely populated baltistan had a population ethnically related to that of ladakh but which practised shia islam to the north also sparsely populated gilgit agency was an area of diverse mostly shia groups and to the west punch was populated mostly by muslims of a different ethnicity than that of the kashmir valley after the indian rebellion of 1857 in which kashmir sided with the british and the subsequent assumption of direct rule by great britain the princely state of kashmir came under the suzerainty of the british crown in the british census of india of 1941 kashmir registered a muslim majority population of 77 a hindu population of 20 and a sparse population of buddhists and sikhs comprising the remaining 3 that same year prem nath bazaz a kashmiri pandit journalist wrote the poverty of the muslim masses is appalling  most are landless laborers working as serfs for absentee hindu landlords   almost the whole brunt of official corruption is borne by the muslim masses under  hindu rule muslims faced hefty taxation and discrimination in the legal system and were forced into labor without any wages conditions in the princely state caused a significant migration of people from the kashmir valley to the punjab of british india for almost a century until the census a small hindu elite had ruled over a vast and impoverished muslim peasantry driven into docility by chronic indebtedness to landlords and moneylenders having no education besides nor awareness of rights the muslim peasants had no political representation until the 1930s ranbir singhs grandson hari singh who had ascended the throne of kashmir in 1925 was the reigning monarch in 1947 at the conclusion of british rule of the subcontinent and the subsequent partition of the british indian empire into the newly independent dominion of india and the dominion of pakistan according to burton steins history of india kashmir was neither as large nor as old an independent state as hyderabad it had been created rather offhandedly by the british after the first defeat of the sikhs in 1846 as a reward to a former official who had sided with the british the himalayan kingdom was connected to india through a district of the punjab but its population was 77 per cent muslim and it shared a boundary with pakistan hence it was anticipated that the maharaja would accede to pakistan when the british paramountcy ended on 14–15 august when he hesitated to do this pakistan launched a guerrilla onslaught meant to frighten its ruler into submission instead the maharaja appealed to mountbatten for assistance and the governorgeneral agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to india indian soldiers entered kashmir and drove the pakistanisponsored irregulars from all but a small section of the state the united nations was then invited to mediate the quarrel the un mission insisted that the opinion of kashmiris must be ascertained while india insisted that no referendum could occur until all of the state had been cleared of irregulars in the last days of 1948 a ceasefire was agreed under un auspices however since the plebiscite demanded by the un was never conducted relations between india and pakistan soured and eventually led to two more wars over kashmir in 1965 and 1999 india has control of about half the area of the former princely state of jammu and kashmir which comprises jammu and kashmir and ladakh while pakistan controls a third of the region divided into two provinces azad kashmir and gilgitbaltistan jammu and kashmir and ladakh are administered by india as union territories they formed a single state until 5 august 2019 when the state was bifurcated and its limited autonomy was revoked according to encyclopædia britannica although there was a clear muslim majority in kashmir before the 1947 partition and its economic cultural and geographic contiguity with the muslimmajority area of the punjab in pakistan could be convincingly demonstrated the political developments during and after the partition resulted in a division of the region pakistan was left with territory that although basically muslim in character was sparsely populated relatively inaccessible and economically underdeveloped the largest muslim group situated in the valley of kashmir and estimated to number more than half the population of the entire region lay in indiaadministered territory with its former outlets via the jhelum valley route blocked the eastern region of the former princely state of kashmir is also involved in a boundary dispute that began in the late 19th century and continues into the 21st although some boundary agreements were signed between great britain afghanistan and russia over the northern borders of kashmir china never accepted these agreements and chinas official position has not changed following the communist revolution of 1949 that established the peoples republic of china by the mid1950s the chinese army had entered the northeast portion of ladakh by 1956–57 they had completed a military road through the aksai chin area to provide better communication between xinjiang and western tibet indias belated discovery of this road led to border clashes between the two countries that culminated in the sinoindian war of october 1962 the region is divided amongst three countries in a territorial dispute pakistan controls the northwest portion northern areas and kashmir india controls the central and southern portion jammu and kashmir and ladakh and the peoples republic of china controls the northeastern portion aksai chin and the transkarakoram tract india controls the majority of the siachen glacier area including the saltoro ridge passes whilst pakistan controls the lower territory just southwest of the saltoro ridge india controls 101338\\xa0km2 39127\\xa0sq\\xa0mi of the disputed territory pakistan controls 85846\\xa0km2 33145\\xa0sq\\xa0mi and the peoples republic of china controls the remaining 37555\\xa0km2 14500\\xa0sq\\xa0mi jammu and azad kashmir lie south and west of the pir panjal range and are under indian and pakistani control respectively these are populous regions gilgitbaltistan formerly known as the northern areas is a group of territories in the extreme north bordered by the karakoram the western himalayas the pamir and the hindu kush ranges with its administrative centre in the town of gilgit the northern areas cover an area of 72971 square kilometres 28174\\xa0sq\\xa0mi and have an estimated population approaching 1\\xa0million 10 lakhs ladakh is between the kunlun mountain range in the north and the main great himalayas to the south capital towns of the region are leh and kargil it is under indian administration and was part of the state of jammu and kashmir until 2019 it is one of the most sparsely populated regions in the area and is mainly inhabited by people of indoaryan and tibetan descent aksai chin is a vast highaltitude desert of salt that reaches altitudes up to 5000 metres 16000\\xa0ft geographically part of the tibetan plateau aksai chin is referred to as the soda plain the region is almost uninhabited and has no permanent settlements though these regions are in practice administered by their respective claimants neither india nor pakistan has formally recognised the accession of the areas claimed by the other india claims those areas including the area ceded to china by pakistan in the transkarakoram tract in 1963 are a part of its territory while pakistan claims the entire region excluding aksai chin and transkarakoram tract the two countries have fought several declared wars over the territory the indopakistani war of 1947 established the rough boundaries of today with pakistan holding roughly onethird of kashmir and india onehalf with a dividing line of control established by the united nations the indopakistani war of 1965 resulted in a stalemate and a unnegotiated ceasefire the kashmir region lies between latitudes 32° and 36° n and longitudes 74° and 80° e it has an area of 68000\\xa0sq\\xa0mi 180000\\xa0km2 it is bordered to the north and east by china xinjiang and tibet to the northwest by afghanistan wakhan corridor to the west by pakistan khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab and to the south by india himachal pradesh and punjab the topography of kashmir is mostly mountainous it is traversed mainly by the western himalayas the himalayas terminate in the western boundary of kashmir at nanga parbat kashmir is traversed by three rivers namely indus jehlum and chenab these river basins divide the region into three valleys separated by high mountain ranges the indus valley forms the north and northeastern portion of the region which include bare and desolate areas of baltistan and ladakh the upper portion of the jhelum valley forms the proper vale of kashmir surrounded by high mountain ranges the chenab valley forms the southern portion of the kashmir region with its denuded hills towards the south it includes almost all of the jammu region high altitude lakes are frequent at high elevations lower down in the vale of kashmir there are many freshwater lakes and large areas of swamplands which include wular lake dal lake and hokersar near srinagar to the north and northeast beyond the great himalayas the region is traversed by the karakoram mountains to the northwest lies the hindu kush mountain range the upper indus river separates the himalayas from the karakoram the karakoram is the most heavily glaciated part of the world outside the polar regions the siachen glacier at 76\\xa0km 47\\xa0mi and the biafo glacier at 63\\xa0km 39\\xa0mi rank as the worlds second and third longest glaciers outside the polar regions karakoram has four eightthousander mountain peaks with k2 the second highest peak in the world at 8611\\xa0m 28251\\xa0ft the indus river system forms the drainage basin of the kashmir region the river enters the region in ladakh at its southeastern corner from the tibetan plateau and flows northwest to run a course through the entire ladakh and gilgitbaltistan almost all the rivers originating in these region are part of the indus river system after reaching the end of the great himalayan range the indus turns a corner and flows southwest into the punjab plains the jhelum and chenab rivers also follow a course roughly parallel to this and join the indus river in southern punjab plains in pakistan the geographical features of the kashmir region differ considerably from one part to another the lowest part of the region consists of the plains of jammu at the southwestern corner which continue into the plains of punjab at an elevation of below 1000 feet mountains begin at 2000 feet then raising to 3000–4000 feet in the outer hills a rugged country with ridges and long narrow valleys next within the tract lie the middle mountains which are 8000–10000 feet in height with ramifying valleys adjacent to these hills are the lofty great himalayan ranges 14000–15000 feet which divide the drainage of the chenab and jehlum from that of the indus beyond this range lies a wide tract of mountainous country of 17000–22000 feet in ladakh and baltistanclarification needed kashmir has a different climate for every region owing to the great variation in altitude the temperatures ranges from the tropical heat of the punjab summer to the intensity of the cold which keeps the perpetual snow on the mountains jammu division excluding the upper parts of the chenab valley features a humid subtropical climate the vale of kashmir has a moderate climate the astore valley and some parts of gilgitbaltistan features a semitibetan climate while as the other parts of gilgitbaltistan and ladakh have tibetan climate which is considered as almost rainless climate the southwestern kashmir which includes much of the jammu province and muzaffarabad falls within the reach of indian monsoon the pir panjal range acts as an effective barrier and blocks these monsoon tracts from reaching the main kashmir valley and the himalayan slopes these areas of the region receive much of their precipitation from the wind currents of the arabian sea the himalayan slope and the pir panjal witness greatest snow melting from march until june these variations in snow melt and rainfall have led to destructive inundations of the main valley one instance of such kashmir flood of a larger proportion is recorded in the 12thcentury book rajatarangini a single cloudburst in july 1935 caused the upper jehlum river level to rise 11 feet the 2014 kashmir floods inundated the kashmir city of srinagar and submerged hundreds of other villages kashmir has a recorded forest area of 20230 square kilometres 7810\\xa0sq\\xa0mi along with some national parks and reserves the forests vary according to the climatic conditions and the altitude kashmir forests range from the tropical deciduous forests in the foothills of jammu and muzafarabad to the temperate forests throughout the vale of kashmir and to the alpine grasslands and high altitude meadows in gilgitbaltistan and ladakh\\nthe kashmir region has four well defined zones of vegetation in the tree growth due to the difference in elevation the tropical forests up to 1500 m are known as the phulai acacia modesta and olive olea cuspid ata zone there occur semideciduous species of shorea robusta acacia catechu dalbergia sissoo albizia lebbeck garuga pinnata terminalia bellirica and t tomentosa and pinus roxburghii are found at higher elevations the temperate zone between 1500–3500 m is referred as the chir pine finns longifolia this zone is dominated by oaks quercus spp and rhododendron spp the blue pine finns excelsa zone with cedrus deodara abies pindrow and picea smithiana occur at elevations between 2800 and 3500 m the birch betula utilis zone has herbaceous genera of anemone geranium iris lloydia potentilla and primula interspersed with dry dwarf alpine scrubs of berberis cotoneaster juniperus and rhododendron are prevalent in alpine grasslands at 3500 m and above kashmir is referred as a beauty spot of the medicinal and herbaceous flora in the himalayas there are hundreds of different species of wild flowers recorded in the alpine meadows of the region the botanical garden and the tulip gardens of srinagar built in the zabarwans grow 300 breeds of flora and 60 varieties of tulips respectively the later is considered as the largest tulip garden of asia kashmir region is home to rare species of animals many of which are protected by sanctuaries and reserves the dachigam national park in the valley holds the last viable population of kashmir stag hangul and the largest population of black bear in asia in gilgitbaltistan the deosai national park is designated to protect the largest population of himalayan brown bears in the western himalayas snow leopards are found in high density in the hemis national park in ladakh the region is home to musk deer markhor leopard cat jungle cat red fox jackal himalayan wolf serow himalayan yellowthroated marten longtailed marmot indian porcupine himalayan mousehare langur and himalayan weasel at least 711 bird species are recorded in the valley alone with 31 classified as globally threatened species in the 1901 census of the british indian empire the population of the princely state of kashmir and jammu was 2905578 of these 2154695 7416 were muslims 689073 2372 hindus 25828 089 sikhs and 35047 121 buddhists implying 935 0032 others the hindus were found mainly in jammu where they constituted a little less than 60 of the population in the kashmir valley the hindus represented 524 in every 10000 of the population ie 524 and in the frontier wazarats of ladhakh and gilgit only 94 out of every 10000 persons 094 in the same census of 1901 in the kashmir valley the total population was recorded to be 1157394 of which the muslim population was 1083766 or 936 and the hindu population 60641 among the hindus of jammu province who numbered 626177 or 9087 of the hindu population of the princely state the most important castes recorded in the census were brahmans 186000 the rajputs 167000 the khattris 48000 and the thakkars 93000 in the 1911 census of the british indian empire the total population of kashmir and jammu had increased to 3158126 of these 2398320 7594 were muslims 696830 2206 hindus 31658 1 sikhs and 36512 116 buddhists in the last census of british india in 1941 the total

808000 2048 and the sikh 55000 139 the kashmiri pandits the only hindus of the kashmir valley who had stably constituted approximately 4 to 5 of the population of the valley during dogra rule 1846–1947 and 20 of whom had left the kashmir valley to other parts of india in the 1950s underwent a complete exodus in the 1990s due to the kashmir insurgency according to a number of authors approximately 100000 of the total kashmiri pandit population of 140000 left the valley during that decade other authors have suggested a higher figure for the exodus ranging from the entire population of over 150 thousand to 190 thousand of a total pandit population of 200 thousand 200000 to a number as high as 300 thousand 300000 people in jammu speak hindi punjabi and dogri the kashmir valley people speak kashmiri and people in the sparsely inhabited ladakh speak tibetan and balti the population of indiaadministered union territories of jammu and kashmir and ladakh combined is 12541302 that of pakistanadministered territory of azad kashmir is 4045366 and that of gilgitbaltistan is 1492924 a muslim shawlmaking family shown in cashmere shawl manufactory 1867 chromolithograph william

around agriculture traditionally the staple crop of the valley was rice which formed the chief food of the people in addition indian corn wheat barley and oats were also grown given its temperate climate it is suited for crops like asparagus artichoke seakale broad beans scarletrunners beetroot cauliflower and cabbage fruit trees are common in the valley and the cultivated orchards yield pears apples peaches and cherries the chief trees are deodar firs and pines chenar or plane maple birch and walnut apple cherry historically kashmir became known worldwide when cashmere wool was exported to other regions and nations exports have ceased due to decreased abundance of the cashmere goat and increased competition from china kashmiris are well adept at knitting and making pashmina shawls silk carpets rugs kurtas and pottery saffron too is grown in kashmir srinagar is known for its silverwork papiermâché woodcarving and the weaving of silk the economy was badly damaged by the 2005 kashmir earthquake which as of 8 october 2005 resulted in over 70000 deaths in the pakistanadministered territory of azad kashmir and around 1500 deaths in the indiaadministered territory of jammu and kashmir transport is predominantly by air or road vehicles in the region kashmir has a 135\\xa0km 84\\xa0mi long modern railway line that started in october 2009 and was last extended in 2013 and connects baramulla in the western part of kashmir to srinagar and banihal it is expected to link  kashmir to the rest of india after the construction of the railway line from katra to banihal is completed
